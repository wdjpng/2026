In this blogpost, we argue the opposite: <strong>hallucination is not an accidental bug, but a predictable, systemic failure resulting from the open-loop generative architecture of current LLMs</strong>. Drawing on systems and control theory, we show that LLMs behave like unstable dynamical systems—generating text without measuring factual error or applying corrective feedback—allowing small mistakes to accumulate and amplify over time. We then contrast this with closed-loop architectures, where real-time monitoring, feedback, and intervention provide a principled path toward more reliable and self-correcting language models.</p> <h2 id="understanding-open-loop-systems-why-hallucination-happens">Understanding Open-Loop Systems: Why Hallucination Happens</h2> <p>In control theory, an open-loop system produces outputs without monitoring whether those outputs remain aligned with a desired target. Without feedback, deviations cannot be detected or corrected. A classic analogy is a vehicle moving forward without sensors: once it drifts off course, nothing steers it back.</p> <p>Large Language Models operate in this same open-loop manner. After receiving a prompt, an LLM generates text autoregressively, without checking whether its output remains factually correct. Each new token is conditioned on previously generated tokens, so any early mistake immediately becomes part of the context. As generation continues, these errors accumulate, leading to compounding inaccuracies and divergence from reality—a hallmark of open-loop instability.</p> <h3 id="missing-feedback-and-error-correction">Missing Feedback and Error Correction</h3> <p><abbr title="A system that incorporates feedback mechanisms to detect and correct errors during its operation. For LLMs, this means having mechanisms to monitor the output, detect potential hallucinations, and adjust the generation process to ensure factual accuracy.">Closed-loop systems</abbr> rely on feedback to measure error and apply corrective action. LLMs lack such mechanisms: there is no signal comparing generated text to ground truth, and uncertainty is not used to regulate behavior. Instead, models are optimized to produce fluent, confident outputs, even when internal evidence is weak. As a result, hallucinations arise not from randomness, but from unchecked error propagation and systematic overconfidence.</p> <h3 id="llms-as-open-loop-dynamical-systems">LLMs as Open-Loop Dynamical Systems</h3> <p>From a control-theoretic perspective, LLMs behave as <abbr title="A system that generates outputs without feedback to correct its behavior. In the context of LLMs, an open-loop system generates text token-by-token based on prior tokens without checking for accuracy or making adjustments based on real-time feedback. Errors can accumulate and amplify without correction, leading to hallucinations.">open-loop systems</abbr>: during <abbr title="A process where a model generates text one token at a time, with each new token being conditioned on all previously generated tokens. This creates a sequential dependency where the next token depends on the prior context, and errors made early in the sequence can propagate and amplify throughout the generation process.">autoregressive decoding</abbr>, they continually condition on their own outputs without checking for factual correctness. The hidden state evolves solely from prior generated tokens and the initial prompt, with no feedback controller to correct deviations. This makes the system inherently drift-prone and unstable.</p> <p>In the autoregressive decoding implementation, the internal hidden state evolves based on the current state and the previous generated output:</p> \[x(t+1)= F(x(t), \hat{y}(t), u_0)\] <p>where</p> <ul> <li> <strong>x(t)</strong> = internal hidden state at generation step <em>t</em> </li> <li> <strong>u₀</strong> = user prompt (initial condition, fixed)</li> <li> <strong>ŷ(t)</strong> = generated token distribution</li> <li> <strong>y*(t)</strong> = desired “ground truth” output (unknown to the model)</li> </ul> <p>Crucially, the mechanism lacks a feedback controller term of the form:</p> \[c(t) = K \cdot (y^*(t) - \hat{y}(t))\] <p>where <strong>c(t)</strong> would be a corrective control signal—meaning no feedback controller exists to correct deviation. This open-loop structure is inherently fragile, drift-prone, and fundamentally unable to guarantee stability.</p> <h3 id="consequences-of-open-loop-generation">Consequences of Open-Loop Generation</h3> <ul> <li>Any initial error (Activation stage) becomes the new state input → <strong>drift</strong>.</li> <li>No measurement of deviation from factual ground truth → <strong>no correction</strong>.</li> <li>Uncertainty is not used as a control signal → <strong>uninhibited guessing</strong>.</li> <li>Confidence inflation from aggregation → <strong>divergence</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>In control terms, LLMs function as nonlinear, self-exciting systems without stabilizing feedback.

Each of these stages begins during pre-training and continues through inference, leading to the final manifestation of hallucinations. Here is a detailed look at the four stages of this process:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Memorization:</strong> During pre-training, the model compresses vast amounts of imperfect data. This process introduces structural vulnerabilities, such as inconsistent facts, gaps in rare knowledge (long-tail issues), and lossy compression, which become latent errors waiting to manifest during later stages of generation. <d-cite key="Huang_2025"></d-cite> </li> <li> <strong>Activation:</strong> When the model receives a query, it activates internal representations. However, LLMs lack uncertainty reporting, so the system often draws upon flawed or uncertain prior knowledge, leading to confident but incorrect guesses.</li> <li> <strong>Drift:</strong> As the model generates text autoregressively, each new token becomes part of the context for the next one. Small initial errors—such as misidentifying an entity—accumulate over time, causing the model’s predictions to drift away from the truth, and these errors are never corrected.</li> <li> <strong>Divergence:</strong> The model’s architecture, including processes like log-sum-exp aggregation, increases confidence in the model’s predictions. This leads the system down incorrect but internally consistent trajectories, reinforcing errors and producing overconfident hallucinations.</li> </ol> <p>This pipeline reframes hallucination as a predictable, stage-wise failure that compounds over time—not an unpredictable glitch.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%200-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%200-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%200-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%200.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 2: Four stages at which hallucination can occur. </div> <h2 id="memorization---the-source-of-hallucination-risk">Memorization - The Source of Hallucination Risk</h2> <p>The Memorization stage is where an LLM acquires its internal, parametric knowledge during pre-training and alignment. Hallucination risk originates here, not as an isolated defect, but as a structural consequence of five forces: imperfections in training data, the mathematical limits of compression, the objectives used to train them, and distortions introduced during post-training refinement. These vulnerabilities remain latent until inference, where they later manifest as activation-time failures.</p> <p>We break down the memorization-phase contributors into five categories.</p> <h3 id="1-data-quality-and-contamination">1. Data Quality and Contamination</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Noisy and Unfaithful Data → Imitative Falsehoods</strong></p> <p>LLMs are trained to maximize the likelihood of strings observed in the pre-training corpus, not to recover ground truth <d-cite key="agrawal2024languagemodelsknowtheyre"></d-cite>. Formally, the objective is</p> \[\theta^* = \arg\max_{\theta} \sum_{(x,y)\in\mathcal{D}} \log p_\theta(y \mid x),\] <p>which rewards distributional fidelity—matching the empirical statistics of the training data—rather than factual correctness. Consequently, any inconsistencies, misconceptions, or outright errors present in the corpus are learned as legitimate statistical patterns.</p> <p>A simple frequency example illustrates this effect. Suppose the corpus contains:</p> <ul> <li>Napoleon was 5′2″: 100 occurrences</li> <li>Napoleon was 5′6″: 10 occurrences</li> </ul> <p>Under the MLE objective, the incorrect fact becomes the model’s most probable output:</p> \[p_\theta(\text{5′2″} \mid x) \approx \frac{100}{110} = 0.91.\] <p>The model is not behaving irrationally—it is faithfully mirroring the empirical distribution it was optimized to imitate. Consequently, frequently repeated misinformation can dominate the learned distribution, leading models to confidently reproduce falsehoods <d-cite key="Ji_2023"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Contradictory Sources → Knowledge Conflict</strong></p> <p>If the LLM is trained on conflicting sources that provide contradictory information regarding the same subject, these inconsistencies are encoded into the model’s internal parameters and the model internalizes a superposition of incompatible facts, which later surfaces as blending, arbitrary selection, or confabulation. Below figure shows that an LLM may ignore the given context and default to a memorized answer, revealing internal knowledge conflicts that lead to arbitrary selection and hallucination. <d-cite key="su2025largelanguagemodelsreally"></d-cite></p> </li> </ul> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%207-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%207-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%207-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%207.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 3: QA models memorize and regurgitate answers regardless of contextual information. </div> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Data Deduplication and Contamination</strong></p> <p>Empirical studies show that deduplication improves factual accuracy and calibration, while data contamination (eval data appearing in pre-training) falsely suppresses hallucination rates and distorts leaderboard performance. <d-cite key="kalai2025languagemodelshallucinate"></d-cite></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Multimodal Noise in MLLMs</strong></p> <p>In vision–language models (VLMs), hallucinations often arise from noisy or misaligned image–text pairs: even if the language model itself is strong, poor-quality multimodal supervision can inject false correlations that surface as hallucinated visual details. <d-cite key="dai2023plausiblefaithfulprobingobject"></d-cite></p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="2-knowledge-distribution-and-statistical-limits">2.

Compression and Entanglement: Structural Limits of Parametric Storage</h3> <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently suffer from Compression and Entanglement, two structural vulnerabilities that arise from the mathematical constraints of finite parametric systems. These vulnerabilities are not due to poor engineering but result from unavoidable limits imposed by information theory, function complexity, and the architecture of transformers. <d-cite key="Huang_2025"></d-cite></p> <h4 id="information-theoretic-boundaries">Information-Theoretic Boundaries</h4> <p>LLMs are parametric functions with finite descriptive complexity, meaning the knowledge they encode must be compressed into a fixed set of parameters. Because the descriptive complexity of real-world knowledge far exceeds any model’s representational capacity, this compression is necessarily lossy. Rare facts, irregular patterns, and one-off events become statistical noise during training, leaving the model to fill gaps using broad correlations rather than precise mappings. When the complexity of the target function exceeds the model’s representational capacity, compression-induced distortion becomes inevitable.</p> <p>This mismatch produces structural hallucination risks:</p> <ul> <li>Rare or irregular facts (dates, one-off events, obscure entities) are incompressible artifacts, poorly captured within dense parameterizations.</li> <li>The model generalizes by fitting statistical regularities, not exact factual mappings. As a result, hallucination persists even with more parameters or better training because infinite knowledge cannot be losslessly encoded in a finite model.</li> <li>Statistical learning theory reinforces this inevitability: given a hypothesis space with <abbr title="The Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension measures how complex a model class is. Standard VC generalization arguments say that the true hallucination rate is at most the training hallucination rate plus an additional penalty that grows with model capacity, decreases with sample size, and stays large for high-capacity models or rare facts—even when training error is low.">VC dimension</abbr> <em>d</em>, generalization error for rare events remains high even if empirical error is low. Therefore, exhaustive memorization is impractical, and hallucinations are theoretically unavoidable. <d-cite key="mohsin2025fundamentallimitsllmsscale"></d-cite> </li> </ul> <h4 id="entangled-representations">Entangled Representations</h4> <p>Another structural vulnerability is entanglement: a form of faulty memory encoding in which distinct pieces of information—often about similar entities or related facts—become blurred or incorrectly linked within the model’s compressed parameter space. It arises during imperfect representation learning, when the model internalizes spurious correlations between different parts of the training data. <d-cite key="Ji_2023"></d-cite></p> <p>This structural flaw seeds latent priors that trigger hallucinations in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Factual Contradiction and Entity Mixing:</strong> First, factual contradiction and entity mixing arise when entanglement causes the model to generate content that diverges from the input, producing either incorrect entities or incorrect relations between them; for example, the model may conflate two similar individuals because it learned the wrong association during decoding. <d-cite key="Huang_2025"></d-cite> </li> <li> <strong>Parametric Knowledge Bias:</strong> Second, parametric knowledge bias occurs because the model tends to rely on its internal, highly compressed (and potentially entangled) parametric knowledge over the information provided in the prompt, amplifying the risk that its output reflects these flawed internal priors rather than the external input.<d-cite key="Ji_2023"></d-cite> </li> </ul> <h4 id="structural-vulnerabilities-in-attention-and-decoding">Structural Vulnerabilities in Attention and Decoding</h4> <p>Even when an LLM has correctly memorized the necessary information, structural bottlenecks in attention and auto-regressive decoding can distort that information during inference.

This constraint leads to problems when multiple plausible continuations exist for a given input. The softmax bottleneck distorts the model's ability to represent uncertainty or multi-modal outputs, often leading to overconfident but incorrect predictions (hallucinations).">Softmax Bottleneck</abbr> is a fundamental architectural constraint rooted in the geometry of the final softmax layer. While softmax is extremely effective for classification, it imposes rigid limitations on generative modeling. It introduces a single-mode bias, favoring token distributions where one option dominates—even in situations where several next-token candidates are equally plausible. This leads to the forced-winner problem, where inherently multi-modal contexts are collapsed into a single choice, suppressing legitimate ambiguity. As a result, the model frequently produces overconfident mis-selections: not because it lacks knowledge, but because the output layer cannot faithfully express uncertainty or represent multi-modal probability mass. In effect, the softmax layer becomes a structural precision bottleneck, unable to fully transmit the richness encoded in the model’s hidden representations, causing fidelity loss during decoding. <d-cite key="mohsin2025fundamentallimitsllmsscale"></d-cite></p> <h5 id="attention-attenuation-and-softmax-crowding">Attention Attenuation and Softmax Crowding</h5> <p>Transformer attention faces fundamental scaling constraints as sequence length grows, amplifying drift and degrading factual accuracy.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Diffusion over long contexts:</strong> As context length increases, attention weights naturally diffuse, reducing the model’s ability to maintain targeted focus.</li> <li> <strong>Crowding effect:</strong> For a single relevant token among $N$ irrelevant ones, that token must achieve an $\Theta(\log N)$ logit advantage merely to maintain constant attention mass.</li> <li> <strong>Structural insufficiency:</strong> In practice, Transformers struggle to achieve this scaling, especially when evidence is sparse or distributed across long inputs.</li> </ul> <p>These limitations drive several downstream failures:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Compounding drift:</strong> where diffused attention causes the model to self-condition on irrelevant content, gradually amplifying errors.</li> <li> <strong>Long-range reasoning breakdown</strong>, as mid-context evidence becomes effectively “lost in the middle,” even when the correct information exists within the model’s parameters.</li> <li> <strong>Unstable recall</strong>, in which slight perturbations in the input shift attention unpredictably, causing the model to intermittently recall—or ignore—key facts.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these vulnerabilities create an irreducible architectural error floor for generative tasks. They motivate decoding-time interventions—such as Context-Aware Decoding (CAD) and Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa)—which aim to counteract overconfident outputs and correct for the structural distortions introduced by the softmax layer and attention mechanism. <d-cite key="Ji_2023"></d-cite></p> <h3 id="4-training-objectives-and-intrinsic-optimization-limits">4.

Each time a predicted token ($x^\theta_t$) replaces a true token ($x^{\text{gold}}_t$), the model conditions on a slightly perturbed state. These perturbations accumulate:</p> \[|x^\theta_{&lt;t} - x^{\text{gold}}_{&lt;t}| \quad \text{increases with } t\] <p>causing the model to drift further from regions it was trained to handle. Over long sequences—such as summarization, story generation, or translation—this cascading divergence amplifies small early errors into large downstream deviations. Prior work shows that exposure bias is a major cause of unstable, drifting generations and directly contributes to hallucination by forcing the model into off-distribution token paths where its learned likelihood estimates become unreliable.

LLMs lack mechanisms for tracking <abbr title="Uncertainty about the model's knowledge, typically caused by insufficient training data or model complexity. This type of uncertainty reflects the gaps in the model's understanding of a task or domain, as opposed to aleatoric uncertainty (which arises from inherent randomness in the data).

This creates a systemic bias toward confident fabrication.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Lack of Cognitive Uncertainty Estimation:</strong> LLMs do not have a built-in system for judging when their knowledge is incomplete. Instead of signaling “I am unsure,” they generate confident answers even when their internal evidence is weak. This happens because the softmax layer, which converts internal model scores into probabilities, tends to exaggerate small differences in logits, producing artificially high confidence. The model confidently misidentifies financial abbreviations, explains concepts incorrectly, and fabricates stock prices despite lacking factual grounding. These outputs show that the model’s surface-level confidence does not reflect its internal uncertainty—an effect amplified by training objectives that prioritize fluent continuation over truthfulness. <d-cite key="kang2023deficiencylargelanguagemodels"></d-cite></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Internal–External Belief Mismatch:</strong> Even when the model’s internal activations contain signals indicating uncertainty or a high likelihood of error, these signals rarely influence the final generated text. In other words, the model may internally “sense” that an answer is unreliable, but the decoding stage still selects a confident-sounding token because it is the locally most probable continuation. This disconnect between <em>internal representations</em> and <em>external behavior</em> results in confident hallucinations, since the output layer does not faithfully convey the uncertainty embedded in the hidden states. <d-cite key="damani2025binaryrewardstraininglms"></d-cite></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Incentivized Guessing:</strong> Because standard training objectives require a next token at every step—and because benchmarks and reward models strongly favor fluency and decisiveness—the model is conditioned to guess whenever it lacks information.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Uncertainty is punished:</strong> “I’m not sure” or abstention is treated as an inferior answer in both SFT and RLHF/DPO.</li> <li> <strong>Confidence is rewarded:</strong> Detailed, fluent answers yield higher reward even when incorrect.</li> <li> <strong>Guessing becomes optimal:</strong> Faced with uncertainty, the model learns that fabrication is a reward-maximizing behavior.</li> </ul> <p>This dynamic is demonstrated clearly in the TruthRL work: an SFT/RLHF-trained model confidently invents a false visa requirement rather than acknowledging insufficient knowledge. In contrast, TruthRL’s modified reward function treats abstention as neutral and penalizes confident hallucinations—causing the model to withhold an answer when it detects uncertainty. The example reveals a deeper truth: current training incentives systematically encourage confident hallucination, whereas alternative reward structures can restore calibrated, uncertainty-aware behavior. <d-cite key="wei2025truthrlincentivizingtruthfulllms"></d-cite></p> </li> </ul> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%205-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%205-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%205-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-hallucination-cs/image%205.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 10: A vanilla SFT/RL model confidently asserts an incorrect visa requirement rather than admitting insufficient information. </div> <h3 id="decoding-dynamics-and-token-selection-errors">Decoding Dynamics and Token Selection Errors</h3> <p>Autoregressive token generation introduces several vulnerabilities tied directly to decoding strategy:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Stochastic sampling and amplified randomness.</strong></p> <p>Randomized samplers (top-k, top-p/nucleus, temperature-scaled sampling) intentionally inject noise to increase diversity.

Without mechanisms for sensing, feedback, and correction, even state-of-the-art models have no means to detect or counteract their own drift. By introducing a closed-loop paradigm—featuring internal observers for uncertainty detection, actuators for real-time control, and iterative feedback loops for refinement—we outlined a path toward more reliable, self-stabilizing LLMs that actively monitor and regulate their own behavior, reducing the risk of harmful hallucinations in high-stakes applications.</p> <p>Looking forward, advancing this paradigm raises several key research directions: integrating real-time feedback mechanisms into existing transformer architectures; empirically validating how observer–actuator–feedback designs influence stability, hallucination rates, and task performance across domains; and addressing the ethical implications of deploying self-correcting systems in fields such as medicine, law, and finance where transparency, fairness, and safety are paramount. Progress here will also require new benchmarks that evaluate stability under drift, uncertainty calibration, and correction effectiveness. Together, these lines of inquiry point toward a new generation of trustworthy, self-correcting LLMs—systems that are not only powerful, but robust, aligned, and prepared for responsible real-world use.</p> </body> </html>
