Yet almost all widely used benchmarks evaluate tasks that are far removed from real industrial systems such as web navigation, coding tasks, synthetic puzzles, or curated IT workflows. In practice, industrial operations demand something more difficult: <strong>multi-agent coordination over heterogeneous telemetry, failure modes, work orders, and safety-critical tasks, all under privacy constraints.</strong> To understand whether current agents can survive this environment, we built a two-part evaluation ecosystem:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>AssetOpsBench</strong> — a multi-modal industrial agent benchmark grounded in real sensor telemetry, failure models, and maintenance workflows [@assetopsbench2025].</li> <li> <strong>AssetOpsBench-Live</strong> — a real-time, privacy-preserving, Codabench-powered competition platform we deployed to 225+ users, yielding over 300 code-submitted agent evaluations [@assetopsbenchlive2026].</li> </ol> <p>This blog post presents what we learned after systematically evaluating LLM agents, not via prompt logs, but through <strong>real code, real trajectories, and real industrial tasks</strong>.</p> <p>The outcome is blunt: <strong>current agentic AI is far less reliable than leaderboard scores suggest.</strong> The challenge surfaces failure modes that traditional agent benchmarks simply never expose.</p> <figure> <img src="../assets/img/2026-04-27-industrial-agent-benchmarking/assetopsbench.png" alt="Failure mode distribution" width="80%"> <figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b>Architecture of the Multi-Agent System: Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM) Agent, Failure Mode Sensor Relations (FMSR) Agent,Work Order (WO) Agent</figcaption> </figure> <hr> <h1 id="why-industrial-agent-evaluation-needs-a-rethink">Why Industrial Agent Evaluation Needs a Rethink</h1> <p>Industrial tasks do not behave like web navigation or software debugging.

They evaluate agents on clean, single-modality tasks with minimal domain constraints. The result is misleading optimism.</p> <p>Real industrial agent evaluation requires:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>multi-agent sequences</strong>, not single policies</li> <li> <strong>ambiguity, missing data, and drift</strong>, not curated inputs</li> <li> <strong>tool invocation correctness</strong>, not text-only reasoning</li> <li> <strong>ground-truth procedural forms</strong>, not free-form answers</li> <li> <strong>privacy-preserving execution</strong>, not public trajectories</li> </ul> <p>AssetOpsBench was designed specifically to fill this gap.</p> <hr> <h1 id="assetopsbench-a-foundation-for-real-world-agent-evaluation">AssetOpsBench: A Foundation for Real-World Agent Evaluation</h1> <p>AssetOpsBench is the first benchmark built around <strong>authentic industrial asset operations</strong> — chillers, AHUs, IoT telemetry, work orders, FMEA data, and domain-authored task scenarios.

Evaluation provides scenario-level and model-level analyses across the six dimensions included in Section 3.2. This pipeline allows anyone to evaluate their agent realistically without accessing private data.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="hidden-scenarios-and-privacy-constraints">Hidden Scenarios and Privacy Constraints</h2> <p>Industrial data cannot be public.<br> Codabench enables:</p> <ul> <li>Running code inside a locked environment</li> <li>Evaluating on scenarios that participants never see</li> <li>Returning only structured scores and failure summaries</li> <li>Ensuring deterministic, reproducible runs</li> </ul> <p>This was essential for wide community participation.</p> <h2 id="two-tracks">Two Tracks</h2> <p>The competition was conducted in two distinct tracks, each designed to stress-test different aspects of multi-agent reasoning and execution.</p> <h3 id="track-1-planning-oriented-multi-agent-orchestration"><strong>Track 1: Planning-Oriented Multi-Agent Orchestration</strong></h3> <p>This track challenged participants to design prompts that convert complex multi-agent interactions into clear, structured DAG-style plans. Successful agents needed to demonstrate correct sequencing, communication across agents, selective tool usage, fallback behavior, and overall orchestration quality.</p> <h3 id="track-2-execution-oriented-dynamic-multi-agent-workflow"><strong>Track 2: Execution-Oriented Dynamic Multi-Agent Workflow</strong></h3> <p>Track 2 focused on the execution side. Participants were asked to move beyond rigid sequential pipelines and develop adaptive, fault-tolerant workflows capable of parallel operation, multi-agent collaboration, shared context propagation, and dynamic decision paths that respond to evolving task states.</p> <hr> <h2 id="methodology-for-selecting-development-vs-testing-instances">Methodology for Selecting Development vs Testing Instances</h2> <h3 id="track-1-feedback-summary"><strong>Track 1 Feedback Summary</strong></h3> <p>Track 1 served as the foundation for analyzing how agents behave under realistic, multi-step industrial constraints. Each submission was evaluated across all six dimensions using a privacy-preserving LLM-as-Judge protocol.</p> <p>Even without revealing execution traces, the evaluation system produced actionable diagnostic signals by analyzing tool-invocation patterns, intermediate outputs, and reasoning structures grounded in real telemetry and work-order data.</p> <p>The resulting failure clusters exposed failure modes that almost never surface in synthetic benchmarks:</p> <ul> <li>missing-data handling failures</li> <li>verification inconsistencies</li> <li>reasoning–action mismatches</li> <li>hallucinations</li> <li>improper or unsafe tool usage</li> </ul> <p>This structured feedback loop allowed developers to pinpoint whether weaknesses stemmed from planning, agent coordination, or execution logic. Ultimately, Track 1 demonstrated the value of iterative, failure-mode–driven refinement: agents became more robust only after developers understood how drift, ambiguity, and multi-hop dependencies break naive agent designs.</p> <h3 id="track-2-utterance-selection"><strong>Track 2 Utterance Selection</strong></h3> <p>Every utterance in AssetOpsBench-Live belongs to a specific operational category—intent interpretation, alert triage, meter analytics, maintenance recommendations, multi-agent instructions, or contextual reasoning. Track 1’s utterances were manually curated to ensure balanced representation across these categories and to incorporate realistic issues such as telemetry gaps, ambiguous alerts, and procedural constraints.</p> <p>For Track 2, we expanded the dataset using a controlled semantic-neighbor strategy:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>For each Track-1 utterance</strong>, we identified its top semantic neighbors <em>within the same operational category</em>.</li> <li>We <strong>filtered out</strong> any neighbors already used in Track 1.</li> <li>We <strong>selected the closest unused neighbor</strong> as the Track-2 counterpart.</li> </ol> <p>This procedure generated paired prompts that share operational grounding but differ in phrasing, contextual cues, or linguistic structure—forcing agents to generalize rather than memorize.</p> <p>The resulting Track-2 dataset maintains:</p> <ul> <li>balanced task-type distribution</li> <li>controlled semantic diversity</li> <li>robustness against overfitting</li> <li>realistic phrasing-drift challenges</li> </ul> <p>This methodology ensures that agents are evaluated not only on correctness, but also on <strong>consistency, reasoning stability, and resilience to subtle linguistic variation</strong>, all of which are essential for real industrial deployments.</p> <hr> <h1 id="community-results-225-users-300-agents-one-reality-check">Community Results: 225 Users, 300+ Agents, One Reality Check</h1> <p>Over the course of the evaluation:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>225+ users</strong> participated</li> <li> <strong>300+ containerized agent submissions</strong> were executed</li> <li>Across <strong>two tracks</strong> (Planning, Execution)</li> <li>Using <strong>dozens of custom agent architectures</strong> and coding styles</li> </ul> <p>This is one of the largest-scale industrial agent evaluations to date.</p> <h2 id="participation-insights-and-competition-dynamics">Participation Insights and Competition Dynamics</h2> <p>The AssetOpsBench-Live challenge ran continuously over a three-month window, allowing participants to iteratively refine their agents while receiving structured, privacy-preserving diagnostic feedback. This long-running format produced several notable patterns:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sustained participation:</strong> Hundreds of submissions arrived steadily throughout the competition, reflecting sustained engagement over the full duration of the challenge. By lowering the barrier to entry with container templates, sample agents, and clear instructions for extending the agent codebase, we enabled both newcomers and experienced practitioners to participate effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Developer experience improvements:</strong> By providing a lightweight entry point for extending or creating new agents, we ensured that participants did not need deep familiarity with industrial systems to begin experimenting. This broadened the contributor base and allowed teams to focus on reasoning strategies instead of infrastructure setup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Submission distribution:</strong> Although we cannot reveal platform URLs or identifiable metadata, aggregated distributions showed diverse iteration behaviors across teams. Some participants submitted frequently, steadily improving their agents through diagnostic feedback, while others converged quickly with only a few targeted submissions. These heterogeneous usage patterns align with the feedback-driven design of AssetOpsBench-Live.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These participation dynamics demonstrate that real-world industrial evaluation can be made accessible without sacrificing rigor, enabling a broad community to meaningfully engage with multi-agent system development.</p> <h2 id="leaderboard-behavior">Leaderboard Behavior</h2> <p>We evaluated leading frontier and open-source models:</p> <ul> <li>gpt-4.1</li> <li>mistral-large</li> <li>llama-4-maverick</li> <li>llama-4-scout</li> <li>llama-3-70b</li> <li>granite-3-8b</li> </ul> <p>Key observations:</p> <ul> <li>Tool-as-Agent significantly outperformed Plan-Execute in correctness</li> <li>Frontier models led, but none surpassed reliability thresholds required for industrial deployment</li> <li>Smaller models collapsed under multi-step reasoning and retrieval constraints</li> </ul> <h2 id="observed-failure-patterns">Observed Failure Patterns</h2> <p>Across <strong>881 recorded trajectories</strong> (from AssetOpsBench), failure categories revealed systemic weaknesses:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>31.2%</strong> — ineffective error recovery</li> <li> <strong>23.8%</strong> — overstated task completion</li> <li> <strong>21.4%</strong> — ambiguous or extraneous formatting</li> <li> <strong>10.3%</strong> — unhandled tool errors</li> <li> <strong>8%</strong> — failure to incorporate feedback</li> </ul> <p>These patterns also appeared consistently in the Codabench evaluations.</p> <h2 id="emergent-failure-modes">Emergent Failure Modes</h2> <p>Beyond the 14 predefined failure modes, agents produced:</p> <ul> <li><strong>185 traces with one new failure mode</strong></li> <li><strong>164 traces with two new emergent failures</strong></li> </ul> <p>Semantic clustering revealed 6 canonical emergent categories, including:</p> <ul> <li>incorrect error handling</li> <li>invalid action formatting</li> <li>mistaken internal state assumptions</li> <li>compound failures involving multiple sub-agents</li> </ul> <p>This underscores the need for <em>adaptive</em> taxonomies as agent complexity increases.</p> <hr> <h1 id="evaluation-and-ranking-methodology">Evaluation and Ranking Methodology</h1> <p>This section defines the official scoring, selection, and ranking workflow used in the AssetOpsBench-Live multi-agent challenge.
