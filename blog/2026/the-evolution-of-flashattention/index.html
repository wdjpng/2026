This was originally developed as an enhancement to RNNs for machine translation <d-cite key="bahdanau2016neuralmachinetranslationjointly"> </d-cite>. However, in 2017, Vaswani et al. <d-cite key="vaswani2023attentionneed"></d-cite> showed that significantly improved performance could be obtained by eliminating the recurrence structure and instead focusing exclusively on the attention mechanism.</p> <p>The importance of this mechanism can be explained with the help of the following example</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_1-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_1-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Attention weights showing how the model resolves ambiguity in word meaning through context. The arrows indicate strong attention connections between 'bank' and contextually relevant words.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Consider the sentence <strong>“I swam across the river to get to the other bank.”</strong> The word “<strong>bank</strong>” has multiple meanings—it could refer to a financial institution or a riverbank. The attention mechanism helps the model understand context by weighing relationships between words. In this case, the model attends strongly to words like “swam,” “across,” and “river,” which provide contextual clues that “bank” refers to a riverbank rather than a financial institution.</p> <p>Therefore, the Attention mechanism has become a critical mechanism driving the growth of Large Language Models. Over the years, several variants of the attention mechanism have been proposed such as Multi Query Attention (MQA) (cite), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), etc. For instance, here’s a non-exhaustive taxonomy of efficient attention mechanisms</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_0-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_0-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_0-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Figure adapted from <d-cite key="sun2025efficient"></d-cite></figcaption> </figure> <p>However, the transformer’s attention mechanism has a limitation: it scales quadratically both in time and memory with sequence length, resulting in $O(n^2 \cdot d_{\text{model}})$ time complexity and $O(n^2)$ memory complexity. For example, a 2,048-token sequence requires 16 MB of memory for the attention matrix; at 16,384 tokens, this increases to 1GB per layer. A mathematical proof is presented in Appendix A. This quadratic scaling makes it prohibitive for processing long sequences beyond 8K-16K tokens without specialized optimizations <d-cite key="keles2022computationalcomplexityselfattention"></d-cite>. While many works aim for sub-quadratic attention using approximations, including Linformer <d-cite key="wang2020linformerselfattentionlinearcomplexity"></d-cite>, Performer <d-cite key="choromanski2022rethinkingattentionperformers"></d-cite>, and Reformer <d-cite key="kitaev2020reformerefficienttransformer"></d-cite>, these methods have seen limited use in large language models. These are approximate attention methods that reduce cost through low-rank projections, kernel approximations, or sparse routing. These assumptions improve asymptotic complexity, but they introduce accuracy and hardware-efficiency tradeoffs, so large-scale models still rely on exact attention.</p> <p>The FlashAttention series by Tri Dao <d-cite key="dao2022flashattention"></d-cite> <d-cite key="dao2023flashattention2"></d-cite><d-cite key="shah2024flashattention3"></d-cite> looks at the attention bottleneck from a systems angle. Instead of approximating attention and hurting model quality, the idea is to rethink how attention moves data through the GPU. Modern GPUs have a very uneven memory hierarchy, so the cost of moving data often dominates the cost of doing the math. FlashAttention reduces this movement and gets closer to the limits of the hardware. In this blog, we walk through how this idea has evolved. FlashAttention v1 introduced <strong>tiled exact attention</strong>. FlashAttention v2 improved how work is split across the GPU. FlashAttention v3 added <strong>warp specialization</strong>, <strong>asynchrony</strong>, and <strong>low precision</strong> on Hopper to push utilization even higher. We also refer to what is known about FlashAttention 4, though an official paper is not public yet.</p> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <h3 id="gpu-memory-hierarchy">GPU Memory Hierarchy</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_2-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_2-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Memory Hierarchy with Bandwidth &amp; Memory Size</figcaption> </figure> <p>Every modern processor faces the same fundamental challenge: fast storage is expensive and small, while large storage is slow and cheap. Modern GPUs organize memory into a hierarchical form which has five distinct levels, each with different characteristics, different access patterns, and different implications for your code. Starting from the fastest and smallest and working towards the slowest and largest, these levels are: registers, shared memory, L1 cache, L2 cache, and global memory (as shown in the above Figure). At the top of the memory hierarchy sit registers, the fastest storage available on a GPU. Each thread running on the GPU has access to a private set of registers - typically up to 255 registers per thread on modern NVIDIA architectures. These registers feed directly into the computational units. When a thread performs an arithmetic operation, the operands come from registers and the result goes back to registers. There is no separate “register access” operation visible to the programmer; registers are simply where the active data lives. The register file on a single Streaming Multiprocessor contains 65,536 registers with each register holding 32 bits. This gives 256 kilobytes of register storage per SM, and these registers are dynamically shared among all threads running on that SM</p> <p>Unlike registers, which are private to each individual thread, shared memory (SRAM) is shared among all threads in a thread block. It is the primary mechanism for threads to cooperate and communicate and is <strong>explicitly managed by the programmer rather than automatically managed by the compiler</strong>. Shared memory provides a staging area for data that multiple threads need to access. Rather than having each thread read the same value from slow global memory, one thread can read it once into shared memory, synchronize with the other threads, and then all threads can read from fast shared memory. Secondly, it enables algorithms that require threads to exchange data. This is used explicitly by FlashAttention.</p> <p>At the bottom of the hierarchy sits global memory - the large DRAM pool that provides the bulk of a GPU’s storage capacity. An H100 for example, has 80GBs of HBM memory, operating at around 3,000 gigabytes per second of bandwidth. This is where your input data starts, where your output data goes, and where any persistent state lives. It is also by far the slowest level of hierarchy, with individual access latencies reaching 400 to 800 clock cycles depending on architecture and access pattern.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Memory Level</th> <th style="text-align: left">Capacity</th> <th style="text-align: left">Bandwidth</th> <th style="text-align: left">Latency</th> <th style="text-align: left">Programmer Control</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Registers</strong></td> <td style="text-align: left">256 KB/SM</td> <td style="text-align: left">~100 TB/s</td> <td style="text-align: left">0 cycles</td> <td style="text-align: left">Automatic</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left"><strong>SRAM</strong></td> <td style="text-align: left">192 KB/SM</td> <td style="text-align: left">19 TB/s</td> <td style="text-align: left">~20 cycles</td> <td style="text-align: left">Explicit</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left"><strong>L2 Cache</strong></td> <td style="text-align: left">40-50 MB</td> <td style="text-align: left">12 TB/s</td> <td style="text-align: left">~200 cycles</td> <td style="text-align: left">Transparent</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left"><strong>HBM</strong></td> <td style="text-align: left">40-80 GB</td> <td style="text-align: left">1.5-2 TB/s</td> <td style="text-align: left">~500 cycles</td> <td style="text-align: left">Explicit</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>When we look at the GPU memory hierarchy in detail, we see a sharp difference in both latency and bandwidth across levels. Registers and shared memory sit close to the compute units and respond within a few cycles. HBM sits hundreds of cycles away with higher bandwidth but much higher latency. This separation means that the location of data often dictates runtime. As an example, the A100 GPU has 40GB of high bandwidth memory (HBM2e) with bandwidth 1.6TB/s and 192KB of on-chip SRAM per each of 108 streaming multiprocessors with bandwidth estimated around 19TB/s <d-cite key="nvidia2020a100"></d-cite>. This shows that the on-chip SRAM is an order of magnitude faster than HBM but many orders of magnitude smaller in size. As L2 Cache is not directly controllable by the programmer we focus on the HBM and SRAM</p> <h3 id="attention-is-memory-bound-despite-on2-compute">Attention is memory bound despite $O(N^{2})$ compute</h3> <p>The efficiency of a kernel is governed by its arithmetic intensity, defined as the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) performed per byte of memory access. Arithmetic Intensity is commonly used to measure whether operations can be classified as either compute-bound or memory-bound. A process is memory-bound when the execution speed is limited by how fast data can be moved between memory (HBM/RAM) and the processor cores, rather than by how fast the cores can compute. Typical examples include elementwise operations such as activation, dropout and reduction operations such as sum, softmax, batch norm, layer norm. A process is compute-bound when the execution speed is limited by the raw processing power (FLOPS) of the cores such as Matrix Multiplication, Convolution</p> \[\text{Arithmetic Intensity} = \frac{\text{FLOPs}}{\text{Bytes Accessed}}\] <p>Standard Attention involves three primary stages</p> <ol> <li>Matrix Multiplication: $ S = Q K^T $</li> <li>Softmax: $ P = \text{softmax}(S) $</li> <li>Matrix Multiplication: $ O = P V $</li> </ol> <p>The matrix multiplications ($QK^T$ and $PV$) are compute-bound operations with high arithmetic intensity ($O(N^2 d)$ FLOPs vs $O(N^2)$ IO). However, the intermediate Softmax operation is memory-bound. It requires reading the entire $N \times N$ matrix $S$ from HBM, performing reduction operations, and writing the resulting $P$ matrix back to HBM. This $O(N^2)$ memory traffic saturates the HBM bandwidth, leaving the powerful Tensor Cores idle. (Detailed Proof provided in Appendix B)</p> <h2 id="flashattention-v1">FlashAttention V1</h2> <p>One of the hardware-efficient mechanisms now widely adopted across different providers is Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness, or FlashAttention. The “IO-Awareness” part of the title describes its core technical principle: optimizing data movement between GPU memory hierarchies.</p> <p>FlashAttention addresses the dual challenges of speed and memory consumption in transformers, especially on long sequences, by rethinking attention algorithms through the lens of GPU memory hierarchy awareness. The key insight is minimizing data movement between high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_3-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_3-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Standard execution loads data from HBM for every step. Kernel fusion and tiling keep data in fast memory longer, reducing memory traffic and improving throughput.</figcaption> </figure> <p>FlashAttention v1, published at Neural Information Processing Systems 2022 by Tri Dao and collaborators, introduced two key innovations: <strong>tiled</strong> attention that processes blocks of queries, keys, and values entirely in SRAM, and an <strong>online softmax algorithm</strong> that computes exact softmax incrementally without materializing the full attention matrix.</p> <h3 id="online-softmax-algorithm-enables-incremental-computation">Online Softmax Algorithm Enables Incremental Computation</h3> <p>Standard softmax computation requires three sequential passes over the data, making it inherently memory-intensive. The first pass finds the maximum value for numerical stability. The second pass computes exponentials and accumulates the normalization sum. The third pass normalizes each element. This three-pass structure can be expressed mathematically as follows:</p> <p>Given a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the numerically stable softmax is computed in three passes:</p> \[\text{Pass 1:} \quad m = \max_{i} x_i\] \[\text{Pass 2:} \quad d = \sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{\,x_i - m}\] \[\text{Pass 3:} \quad \text{softmax}(x)_i = \frac{e^{\,x_i - m}}{d}\] <p>This approach ensures numerical stability by preventing overflow in the exponential computation. However, this three-pass dependency creates a critical bottleneck: we must materialize the entire attention matrix in HBM before proceeding. The softmax operation requires global information—specifically, the denominator in Pass 2 must sum over all $N$ elements. This seemingly requires loading the full row into memory before computing any output, making the process extremely memory I/O intensive and defeating attempts to tile the computation efficiently.</p> <p>The breakthrough came from <strong>online softmax</strong>, an algorithmic technique that computes softmax incrementally in blocks while maintaining running statistics for the maximum and the sum of exponentials. This method was originally discovered by Milakov and Gimelshein <d-cite key="milakov2018online"></d-cite> and later applied to sparse attention patterns by Child et al. <d-cite key="child2019generatinglongsequencessparse"></d-cite>. FlashAttention’s key innovation was adapting online softmax to work within a tiled attention algorithm, enabling exact softmax computation without materializing the full attention matrix. Instead of waiting for the global maximum $m_N$ across all elements before computing the normalization sum, the algorithm maintains running statistics that are updated as each new block of data is processed. This incremental approach transforms softmax into a streaming computation that can be fused with the surrounding matrix operations.</p> <h3 id="algebra-of-online-softmax">Algebra of Online Softmax</h3> <p>Online softmax allows combining partial results without revisiting the raw data. In a streaming (block-wise) setting, we process the sequence in chunks. Let’s assume we have processed the first block of keys and have a local maximum $m_{old}$ and a local unnormalized sum $\ell_{old}$ (where $\ell = \sum e^{x_j - m}$). Now, we load a new block of keys and compute their raw scores.

It allows us to update the running sum using only the previous statistics ($m_{old}$ and $\ell_{old}$) and the new block statistics, without ever loading the earlier blocks from HBM again. The exponential correction terms ensure numerical stability throughout the incremental computation by properly rescaling all exponentials relative to the current global maximum.

The two primary bottlenecks were <strong>suboptimal parallelism</strong>, which led to <strong>low occupancy</strong>, and <strong>inefficient work partitioning</strong>, which resulted in excessive non-matrix-multiply operations.</p> <h4 id="parallelism-bottleneck">Parallelism Bottleneck</h4> <p>FlashAttention v1 parallelized computation over the batch size ($B$) and the number of heads ($H$). Consequently, the total number of thread blocks launched was $B \times H$. In scenarios with long context lengths, the batch size is often reduced (e.g., $B=1$) to fit the model into memory. If the number of heads is also small (e.g., 12 or 32), the GPU launches only a handful of thread blocks. Given that an A100 GPU has 108 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), launching only 32 thread blocks leaves over 70% of the GPU’s compute resources idle. This phenomenon is known as <strong>low occupancy</strong>.</p> <h4 id="non-matmul-overhead">Non-Matmul Overhead</h4> <p>Furthermore, the online softmax in FlashAttention v1 performed rescaling at every iteration. On modern GPUs equipped with Tensor Cores, non-matrix-multiply operations (like exponentiation and division) are significantly more expensive per FLOP than matrix multiplications. For instance, the A100 delivers 312 TFLOPS for FP16 matrix multiplications but only 19.5 TFLOPS for other FP32 operations.</p> <h3 id="improvements-in-flashattention-2">Improvements in FlashAttention-2</h3> <p>FlashAttention-2, released in July 2023, achieves a ~2x speedup over v1 by addressing these architectural inefficiencies. The authors identified that v1 processed each attention head largely serially within a single thread block, underutilizing the parallelism available on modern GPUs. Additionally, the work partitioning within blocks caused unnecessary communication overhead between warps.</p> <h4 id="optimization-1-reducing-non-matmul-flops">Optimization 1: Reducing Non-Matmul FLOPs</h4> <p>FlashAttention-2 introduces <strong>algebraic simplifications</strong> to minimize non-matrix-multiply operations.

Note the specialized Tensor Cores for matrix math vs. SFUs for activation functions.</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>1. Deferring Normalization:</strong> In FlashAttention v1, the output matrix $O$ is rescaled at every iteration to maintain numerical stability: \(O^{\text{new}} = \text{diag}(\ell^{\text{new}})^{-1} \left( \text{diag}(\ell) e^{m - m^{\text{new}}} O + e^{\tilde{m} - m^{\text{new}}} \tilde{V} \right)\) This requires performing vector-matrix divisions at every step. FlashAttention-2 instead maintains an <strong>un-normalized</strong> output accumulator $\tilde{O}$ throughout the loop: \(\tilde{O}^{\text{new}} = \text{diag}(e^{m - m^{\text{new}}}) \tilde{O} + e^{\tilde{m} - m^{\text{new}}} \tilde{V}\) The expensive division operation is performed only once at the very end of the loop: $O = \text{diag}(\ell^{\text{final}})^{-1} \tilde{O}$. This simple reordering significantly reduces the number of non-matmul FLOPs.</p> <p><strong>2. LogSumExp Storage:</strong> To further reduce memory overhead, FlashAttention-2 changes the statistics stored for the backward pass. Instead of storing both the maximum $m$ and the sum of exponentials $\ell$, it stores a single log-sum-exp value $L$: \(L = m + \log(\ell)\) During the backward pass, the required statistics can be derived as $\ell = \exp(L - m)$. This halves the memory footprint for metadata, allowing for larger block sizes and better occupancy.</p> <h4 id="optimization-2-loop-reordering-split-k-to-split-q">Optimization 2: Loop Reordering (Split-K to Split-Q)</h4> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_10-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_10-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_10-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>The original FlashAttention used a loop order where the outer loop iterated over $K, V$ blocks and the inner loop over $Q$ blocks. This minimized repeated loads of $K$ and $V$ from HBM, but required writing partial results to the output accumulator $O$ back to HBM after each step. This “Split-K” style (accumulating results across $K$) creates dependencies that are difficult to parallelize without atomic updates, particularly when multiple warps share the same output.</p> <p>FlashAttention-2 inverts this loop hierarchy. Specifically:</p> <ul> <li>FlashAttention v1: Outer Loop ($K, V$), Inner Loop ($Q$).</li> <li>FlashAttention-2: Outer Loop ($Q$), Inner Loop ($K, V$).</li> </ul> <p>Let us divide $Q$ into $T_r$ blocks and $K, V$ into $T_c$ blocks. In FlashAttention-2, a thread block loads a specific block $Q_i$ into SRAM. It then iterates through all blocks of keys and values ($K_1, V_1$ to $K_{T_c}, V_{T_c}$) (as shown in the above Figure). Since $Q_i$ is fixed for the duration of the inner loop, the corresponding output block $O_i$ is also fixed. The thread block can maintain $O_i$ entirely in registers (the fastest memory) throughout the entire computation. There is no need for atomic additions or synchronization between thread blocks regarding the output, as they write to disjoint regions of HBM. The algorithm accumulates the results of $Q_i \times K_j^\top \times V_j$ directly into registers. Only after the inner loop finishes (all $K, V$ processed) is the final result $O_i$ written to HBM. This simplifies control flow, improves memory coalescing, and completely eliminates the need to write partial results to HBM and read them back, ensuring that $O$ is written exactly once.</p> <h4 id="optimization-3-sequence-parallelism-and-warp-partitioning">Optimization 3: Sequence Parallelism and Warp Partitioning</h4> <p><strong>Sequence Parallelism:</strong> FlashAttention-2 solves the low occupancy issue by introducing parallelism over the sequence length dimension. Instead of assigning one thread block per attention head, v2 assigns thread blocks to chunks of the sequence. With an outer loop over $Q$ blocks, we can treat each block $Q_i$ as an independent unit of work.</p> <p>For example, if the sequence length $N=8192$ and the block size $B_r = 128$, there are $T_r = 64$ blocks of $Q$.</p> <ul> <li>For a single head, we can now launch 64 thread blocks.</li> <li>For 12 heads, we launch $12 \times 64 = 768$ thread blocks.</li> </ul> <p>This approach easily saturates the 108 SMs of an A100, even with a batch size of 1, ensuring high occupancy and utilization regardless of input dimensions.</p> <p><strong>Improved Warp Partitioning:</strong> A major innovation in v2 is parallelizing across the sequence dimension. Instead of one thread block handling one $(i,j)$ pair at a time, FlashAttention-2 splits the work of a single attention head into multiple thread blocks and warps.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_15-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_15-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_15-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention/Figure_15.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Comparison of Warp Partitioning: Split-K (FA1) vs Split-Q (FA2)</figcaption> </figure> <p>FlashAttention v1 used a “Split-K” scheme where 4 warps each computed a slice of $K^{T}$ and then synchronized to aggregate results. This required writing intermediate results to shared memory, barrier synchronization across warps, and reading/summing partial results.</p> <p>In v2, the work within a thread block is partitioned differently. Since the outer loop is over $Q$, the thread block is responsible for a block of rows of $Q$. This “Split-Q” scheme allows warps to partition $Q$ instead of $K/V$.

Warp Specialization: Producer-Consumer Model</h4> <p>FA3 splits the warps in a thread block into two specialized groups with distinct responsibilities, leveraging Hopper’s asynchronous nature:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Producer Warps:</strong> exclusively issue TMA instructions to load data from global memory into a <strong>circular buffer</strong> in shared memory. Since TMA is asynchronous, a single warp can keep the memory pipeline full. For a deeper dive into TMA, see the CUTLASS tutorial <d-cite key="cutlass-tma"></d-cite> or Modal’s hardware glossary <d-cite key="modal-tma"></d-cite>.</li> <li> <strong>Consumer Warps:</strong> exclusively execute WGMMA and softmax instructions. They never issue memory loads.</li> </ul> <p>This separation allows for true hardware-level parallelism. While consumer warps compute on stage $i$, producer warps load stage $(i+s) \mod s$ in parallel. Additionally, FA3 utilizes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setmaxnreg</code> instruction for <strong>dynamic register reallocation</strong>. Producer warps need few registers, while consumer warps need many for accumulators. The hardware allows reallocating registers from producers to consumers to maximize occupancy.</p> <h4 id="2-gemm-softmax-pipelining-pingpong-scheduling">2. GEMM-Softmax Pipelining (Pingpong Scheduling)</h4> <p>To break the sequential dependency bottleneck ($GEMM \rightarrow Softmax \rightarrow GEMM$), FA3 introduces <strong>Pingpong Scheduling</strong> between warpgroups:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Iteration $j$:</strong> Warpgroup 1 executes the high-throughput GEMMs for blocks $j$ and $j+1$.</li> <li> <strong>Simultaneously:</strong> Warpgroup 2 executes the low-throughput Softmax for block $j-1$ on the Multi-Function Unit (MUFU), which is separate from Tensor Cores.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Intra-Warpgroup Pipelining (2-Stage Pipeline):</strong> Beyond producer-consumer overlap, FA3 pipelines execution <em>within</em> each consumer warpgroup. By reordering instructions, the WGMMA for the next iteration can be issued before the Softmax of the current iteration completes. This <strong>2-stage pipeline</strong> hides the latency of the non-GEMM operations and is the precursor to the more complex 5-stage pipeline seen in FA4.</p> <h4 id="3-low-precision-with-block-quantization">3.

We also examined the codebase that surfaced on GitHub.

Software-Simulated Exponentiation (Softmax Warps)</h3> <p>One of the optimizations in FlashAttention 4 is not new at all; it has a direct precedent in a 25-year-old academic paper. In 1999, N. N. Schraudolph published “a fast, compact approximation of the exponential function” <d-cite key="schraudolph1999fast"></d-cite>. Schraudolph’s core insight was that the exponential function (exp) could be rapidly approximated by cleverly manipulating the components of a standard IEEE-754 floating-point number.</p> <p>Modern GPUs contain Special Function Units (SFUs), which are dedicated hardware circuits designed to accelerate transcendental math operations like the exponential function. However, FlashAttention 4 revealed that these specialized SFUs become a performance bottleneck. There are far fewer SFUs than general-purpose CUDA cores on a GPU’s streaming multiprocessor. When thousands of threads simultaneously request an exponential calculation for the softmax function, the SFUs become overloaded, leading to stalls. On Blackwell GPUs, this bottleneck can be so significant that for a common configuration, the softmax computation takes approximately twice as long (1024 cycles) as each of the two main matrix multiplications (512 cycles each).</p> <p>FA4 addresses this by moving the exponential calculation onto the general-purpose CUDA Cores using dedicated <strong>Softmax warps</strong>. The calculation approximates $2^x = 2^i \cdot 2^f$ by:</p> <ul> <li>Using a cubic polynomial approximation $P(f)$ for the fractional part $2^f$, often performed using three fused multiply-adds (FMA).</li> <li>Scaling by the integer part $2^i$ through adding the integer $i$ directly to the exponent field of the floating-point number, rather than requiring a full multiplication.</li> </ul> <p>This software-based approach allows the kernel to compute two exponential values simultaneously, doubling the parallelism of this step and bypassing the SFU bottleneck entirely.</p> <h3 id="3-selective-rescaling-correction-warps">3. Selective Rescaling (Correction Warps)</h3> <p>To maintain numerical stability during the attention calculation, kernels must frequently rescale intermediate values. Traditionally, this happens every time a new maximum score is found. Each rescaling operation requires a synchronization point, which introduces coordination overhead. In FA4’s highly asynchronous pipeline, where different warps handle loading, computation, and correction simultaneously, these synchronization events are particularly costly as they can force the entire pipeline to halt and wait.</p> <p>FlashAttention 4, through its specialized Correction warps, adopts a <strong>selective approach</strong>: <strong>selective rescaling</strong>. Instead of rescaling every time the maximum value changes, the kernel only performs the operation when the change is “significant enough to affect numerical correctness.” The impact of this change is significant, resulting in a 10x reduction in rescaling operations. Fewer rescaling operations mean fewer synchronization points and pipeline stalls, significantly reducing overhead and contributing to the kernel’s overall speed.</p> <p>Mathematically, let’s define the maximum attention score utilized as the scaling factor, $m_{\text{old}}$, and the pre-defined tolerance threshold, $\epsilon$:</p> <ul> <li>$m_{\text{old}} = \text{Current Running Maximum}$</li> <li>$\epsilon = \text{Tolerance Threshold (e.g., related to machine epsilon)}$</li> </ul> <p>The kernel checks if the difference between the new maximum ($m_{\text{new}}$) and the old maximum ($m_{\text{old}}$) is numerically large enough to potentially compromise precision. This is the core condition for selective rescaling:</p> \[\text{Difference} = \lvert m_{\text{new}} - m_{\text{old}} \rvert\] <p><strong>Check Condition:</strong> $\lvert m_{\text{new}} - m_{\text{old}} \rvert &gt; \epsilon$?</p> <p><strong>Case A: No Rescaling Triggered</strong> If $\lvert m_{\text{new}} - m_{\text{old}} \rvert \le \epsilon$:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Action:</strong> No rescaling is performed.</li> <li> <strong>Result:</strong> The previous running maximum $m_{\text{old}}$ is kept, and the kernel avoids the synchronization overhead.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Case B: Rescaling Triggered</strong> If $|m_{\text{new}} - m_{\text{old}}| &gt; \epsilon$, rescaling is required to prevent numerical overflow and maintain precision.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Update Maximum:</strong> The new maximum $m_{\text{new}}$ becomes the current scaling factor. \(m_{\text{old}} \leftarrow m_{\text{new}}\)</li> <li> <strong>Trigger Correction:</strong> The Softmax warps signal the Correction warps.</li> <li> <strong>Apply Correction:</strong> The Correction warps update the previously accumulated output values to maintain numerical correctness relative to the new, larger scale.</li> </ul> <h3 id="4-blackwell-hardware-exploitation-and-tensor-memory">4. Blackwell Hardware Exploitation and Tensor Memory</h3> <p>FlashAttention 4 is purpose-built to leverage the specific architectural features of NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPUs, most notably <strong>Tensor Memory</strong>. In previous architectures, managing intermediate results often required shuffling data between registers and shared memory, creating bottlenecks. Blackwell introduces Tensor Memory as a programmer-managed L1 cache designed specifically to hold and accumulate intermediates, such as unnormalized attention scores ($S$) and output values ($O$), directly during Tensor Core operations.</p> <p>The kernel utilizes the <strong>Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA)</strong> to handle asynchronous memory loads, significantly reducing register pressure by firing off copy operations asynchronously. Furthermore, FA4 simplifies matrix operations by relying on single Cooperative Thread Array (CTA) matrix multiplications (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cta_group::1</code>). This means it <strong>no longer requires warp groups</strong> for optimal performance—a departure from the complexity required in previous generations to saturate the GPU.</p> <h3 id="5-complete-warp-specialization-roles">5. Complete Warp Specialization Roles</h3> <p>While the 5-stage pipeline was introduced earlier, the true power of FA4 lies in the strict specialization of its warps. Each warp type has a singular focus, preventing resource contention and context switching overhead:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Load Warps:</strong> These are dedicated solely to maximizing memory bandwidth. They pre-fetch Query, Key, and Value data blocks from global memory into shared memory, ensuring the compute units never starve for data.</li> <li> <strong>MMA Warps:</strong> These warps focus purely on computation. They drive the Tensor Cores to compute the partial attention score matrix ($QK^T$) and accumulate value tiles ($PV$) into the output tiles, without being burdened by memory management or control logic.</li> <li> <strong>Store/Epilogue Warps:</strong> Dedicated to the final stage of the pipeline, these warps manage the efficient transfer of accumulated output blocks from on-chip memory back to global memory, handling the necessary data layout transformations.</li> </ul> <h3 id="6-performance-context-and-current-limitations">6. Performance Context and Current Limitations</h3> <p>FlashAttention 4 marks a milestone in GPU computing as the <strong>first attention kernel to break the petaflop threshold</strong>, achieving over $10^{15}$ floating-point operations per second. It reaches an efficiency of approximately <strong>30% MFU</strong> (Model Flops Utilization), performing 5–10% to 22% faster than NVIDIA’s standard cuDNN implementation.</p> <p>However, as an early release targeting a new architecture, it currently has specific limitations:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Forward Pass Only:</strong> The current implementation supports only forward propagation, with backward pass support planned for future releases.</li> <li> <strong>BF-16 Precision:</strong> The kernel operates exclusively in BF-16 precision.</li> <li> <strong>Future Optimizations:</strong> It does <strong>not yet utilize FP4 operations</strong> or <strong>2-CTA matrix multiplications</strong>, which are key Blackwell features that promise even greater performance gains in the future.</li> </ul> <h2 id="principles-for-future-attention-algorithms">Principles for Future Attention Algorithms</h2> <p>The evolution from FlashAttention v1 through v4 reveals several core principles that extend beyond simply optimizing existing attention mechanisms. These principles form a foundation for thinking about future attention algorithms as the hardware landscape continues to evolve.</p> <p>First, memory hierarchy awareness must become a first-class concern in algorithm design. The FlashAttention series demonstrates that asymptotic complexity alone is insufficient—the IO complexity term O(N²d²M⁻¹) matters as much as the FLOP count. Future attention mechanisms should be designed with explicit consideration of data movement costs across the memory hierarchy. This means algorithms cannot treat memory as a flat abstraction but must account for the multi-level nature of modern GPU memory systems.</p> <p>Second, kernel fusion and recomputation trade-offs offer underexplored design space. FlashAttention’s backward pass trades additional compute for reduced memory traffic, exploiting the fact that modern accelerators are increasingly memory-bound rather than compute-bound. This suggests a broader principle: as the compute-to-bandwidth ratio continues to grow in future hardware, selectively recomputing intermediate values rather than storing them becomes increasingly favorable. The question becomes which intermediate tensors to materialize and which to recompute, a decision that depends on both the operation’s arithmetic intensity and its position in the dependency graph.</p> <p>Third, hardware-algorithm co-design requires specialization at the warp level. FlashAttention v3 and v4’s progression toward fine-grained warp specialization—separating producer, consumer, and correction roles—suggests that future kernels must exploit asynchronous execution models more aggressively. The trend toward heterogeneous functional units (Tensor Cores, SFUs, CUDA cores) means algorithms should explicitly partition work to match the throughput characteristics of each unit type, rather than treating the GPU as a homogeneous compute resource.</p> <p>Finally, numerical precision is a tunable parameter, not a fixed constraint. FlashAttention-3’s block quantization and FA4’s software-based exponential approximation demonstrate that carefully managed low-precision computation can maintain accuracy while improving throughput. Future algorithms might adaptively select precision per-operation based on numerical sensitivity analysis, potentially using FP8 or FP4 for matmuls while maintaining higher precision only where gradients demand it.</p> <p>These principles point toward a future where attention mechanisms are not merely approximate variants of the standard formulation, but fundamentally redesigned algorithms that achieve exact results through hardware-conscious implementation strategies.</p> <h2 id="appendix-a-standard-attention-complexity">Appendix A: Standard Attention Complexity</h2> <p>The standard self-attention mechanism in Transformers is formally defined as:</p> \[\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V\] <p>where inputs $Q, K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$ and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_v}$ represent the query, key, and value matrices respectively. The computation proceeds in three sequential stages, each contributing to the overall computational cost.</p> <p>First, we compute the attention score matrix $S = \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}$. This operation involves a matrix multiplication between $Q$ and $K^T$, resulting in an $n \times n$ matrix. Since each of the $n^2$ entries requires a dot product of size $d_k$, the computational cost is proportional to the number of elements multiplied by the dimension size.</p> \[\text{Time Complexity (Scores)} = O(n^2 d_k)\] <p>Crucially, this step requires storing the intermediate matrix $S$, which scales quadratically with the sequence length $n$. This $O(n^2)$ memory requirement is the primary bottleneck for long sequences.</p> <p>Second, we apply the softmax function row-wise to normalize the scores. For each of the $n$ rows, we compute exponentials, sum them, and divide to normalize. As this is performed for every element in the $n \times n$ matrix, the cost is quadratic.</p> \[\text{Time Complexity (Softmax)} = O(n^2)\] <p>Finally, we compute the weighted sum of values by multiplying the normalized probability matrix $P = \text{softmax}(S)$ with the value matrix $V$. This results in an output matrix of size $n \times d_v$. Similar to the first step, each of the $n \times d_v$ output elements requires a dot product of length $n$.</p> \[\text{Time Complexity (Aggregation)} = O(n^2 d_v)\] <p>Summing these components gives the total time complexity:</p> \[\text{Total Time} = O(n^2 d_k) + O(n^2) + O(n^2 d_v) = O(n^2(d_k + d_v))\] <p>In typical Transformer architectures, the head dimensions $d_k$ and $d_v$ are proportional to the model dimension $d_{\text{model}}$. Thus, the complexity is often simplified to $O(n^2 d_{\text{model}})$.</p> <h3 id="scalability-implications">Scalability Implications</h3> <p>The quadratic dependency on sequence length $n$ creates significant resource challenges as context length increases. The table below illustrates how computational cost and memory usage grow with sequence length, assuming a hidden dimension of $d=768$.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Sequence Length</th> <th style="text-align: left">Relative Compute Cost</th> <th style="text-align: left">Memory (GB)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">512</td> <td style="text-align: left">1×</td> <td style="text-align: left">0.001</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">2,048</td> <td style="text-align: left">16×</td> <td style="text-align: left">0.016</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">8,192</td> <td style="text-align: left">256×</td> <td style="text-align: left">0.25</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">65,536</td> <td style="text-align: left">16,384×</td> <td style="text-align: left">16</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">1M</td> <td style="text-align: left">4,000,000×</td> <td style="text-align: left">4,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="theoretical-lower-bounds">Theoretical Lower Bounds</h3> <p>One might ask if it is possible to compute attention more efficiently than $O(n^2)$. Research grounded in the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) suggests that this quadratic cost is fundamental. Specifically, it has been proven that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, computing the softmax dot-product attention requires $\Omega(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time.</p> <p>This lower bound holds for exact computation as well as for multiplicative and additive approximations. The proof relies on a reduction from the Orthogonal Vectors Problem (OVP). Intuitively, to accurately determine the attention distribution, the algorithm must evaluate pairwise interactions between query and key vectors. In high-dimensional spaces, distinguishing between orthogonal and nearly-orthogonal vectors requires checking all pairs, which establishes the $\Omega(n^2)$ barrier.</p> <h2 id="appendix-b-memory-bound-proof">Appendix B: Memory Bound Proof</h2> <p>We prove that standard attention is memory-bound by analyzing the Arithmetic Intensity ($AI$) of its components. An operation is memory-bound if its $AI$ is lower than the hardware’s critical threshold ($I_{crit}$). For an NVIDIA A100, $I_{crit} \approx 12.5$ FLOPs/Byte.</p> <p>Standard attention consists of three kernels:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>MatMul 1 ($S = QK^T$):</strong> Compute-bound ($AI \approx 64$ for $d=64$).</li> <li> <strong>Softmax ($P = \text{softmax}(S)$):</strong> Memory-bound.</li> <li> <strong>MatMul 2 ($O = PV$):</strong> Compute-bound ($AI \approx 64$).</li> </ol> <p><strong>Analysis of the Softmax Kernel:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>Compute:</strong> Softmax performs element-wise operations (exp, sum, div) on the $N \times N$ matrix. This requires approximately 5 FLOPs per element. \(\text{FLOPs} \approx 5N^2\)</li> <li> <strong>Memory:</strong> The kernel must read the full matrix $S$ from HBM and write the full matrix $P$ back to HBM. For FP16 precision ($P=2$ bytes), the data movement is: \(\text{Bytes} = 2 \times (N^2 \text{ read} + N^2 \text{ write}) = 4N^2\)</li> <li> <strong>Arithmetic Intensity:</strong> \(AI_{\text{softmax}} = \frac{5N^2}{4N^2} = 1.25 \text{ FLOPs/Byte}\)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Since $1.25 \ll 12.5$, the Softmax kernel is severely memory-bound. It forces the GPU compute cores to stall while waiting for $O(N^2)$ data to move to and from HBM. Therefore, despite the high compute complexity of the matrix multiplications, the intermediate materialization of the attention matrix creates a bandwidth bottleneck that limits overall performance.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/2026/assets/bibliography/2026-04-27-the-evolution-of-flashattention.bib"></d-bibliography> <d-article> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/fairness-audits/">Fairness Audits as Theater: When Metrics Mask Structural Harm</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/fans/">FANS - Frequency-Adaptive Noise Shaping for Diffusion Models</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/why-vlms-waste-their-vision/">Why vlms waste their vision</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/wait-do-we-need-to-wait/">Wait, Do We Need to Wait?
