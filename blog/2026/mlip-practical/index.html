From materials science to drug discovery, biophysics, fusion research, and catalysis: accurate tools capable of simulating millions of atoms for nanoseconds within a practical timeframe could have profoundly positive implications from academia and industry to society at large<d-cite key="fu2023solvent, buehler2004atomic, perilla2017physical, nordlund2006atomistic, yu2023constantpotential, johansson2022micronscale"></d-cite>. Among the particularly interesting simulation candidates are MOFs, capable among other things of actively absorbing carbon dioxide for carbon capture to storing hydrogen<d-cite key="sumida2012carbon, chen2020balancing"></d-cite>. Traditionally, two options exist for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations: Use <em>prohibitively expensive</em> ab-initio (from first principles) methods for quantum-level accuracy, or settle for <em>significant inaccuracy</em> by using inexpensive empirical potentials<d-cite key="burke2012perspective, lennard1924determination"></d-cite>. In recent years MLIPs have emerged, striving to offer the speed of empirical potentials while maintaining the accuracy of ab-initio methods like density functional theory (DFT), essentially providing the best of both worlds<d-cite key="goeminne2023dft, SchNet, schutt2021painn"></d-cite>. However, their practical applicability is still an open question of ongoing research in the field. The general black-box nature of all ML models, with the complex architectures, specialized training procedures and datasets of MLIPs, paired with their slow integration into commonly used MD software programs pose a significant barrier for researchers and practitioners to use, understand and adopt this promising new paradigm.</p> <p>In this blog post, we will give an overview of the most important MLIPs and their architectures, followed by a discussion of their practical applicability in terms of their speed, compatibility with commonly used MD software programs and their accuracy on a practical example.</p> <h2 id="overview-of-mlips">Overview of MLIPs</h2> <p>Even though DFT methods heavily improve speed and scaling properties for AIMD compared to SOTA coupled cluster methods, they’re still too slow for large scale systems, usually the more interesting ones. One key problem is the fact that DFT approximates the entire wave function, in essence solving the entire system completely, every single time step, which is very costly and scales poorly with system size. But for MD we only care about the forces acting on the atoms, which are derived from the wave function, not the wave function itself. So if there was a way to compute the forces from atomic positions directly, we could skip the highly expensive wave function calculation entirely. MLIPs are trained on a dataset of DFT calculations to learn this mapping as accurately as possible, potentially providing the best of the two worlds: the accuracy of DFT with the speed of cheap empirical potentials.</p> <p><strong>Explicit MLIPs</strong> These take as input, for $N$ atoms, their positions $R \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 3}$ and species $Z \in \mathbb{Z}^{N}$, and learn the mapping to energy $E \in \mathbb{R}$, forces $F \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 3}$ and stress $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 6}$ directly. This is considered the straightforward and intuitive approach, but no energy conservation guarantees are offered by it.</p> \[F_i, E, \sigma_{\alpha \beta} = f_\theta(r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n)\] <p>These MLIPs are also referred to as direct-force predictors.</p> <p><strong>Implicit MLIPs</strong> These take as input, for $N$ atoms, their positions $R \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 3}$ and species $Z \in \mathbb{Z}^{N}$, and a mapping is learned to the potential energy $E \in \mathbb{R}$ of the system alone:</p> \[E = f_\theta(r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n)\] <p>The forces $F_i$, the stress $\sigma$, and the strain tensors $\epsilon_{\alpha \beta}$ are then computed by taking the negative gradient of the network with respect to the atomic positions $r_i$ and the strain tensors $\epsilon_{\alpha \beta}$ respectively.</p> \[\mathbf{F}_i = - \nabla_{\mathbf{r}_i} E \quad\text{and}\quad \sigma_{\alpha \beta} = \frac{1}{V} \frac{\partial E}{\partial \epsilon_{\alpha \beta}}\] <p>They are also called conservative MLIPs. <d-cite key="chmiela2017mlff"></d-cite> were the first to describe this idea in their gradient-domain MLIP approach. The big problem with this approach is the second backpropagation step, which is very costly, especially for training where you now need a gradient of a gradient.</p> <h3 id="schnet-2018">SchNet (2018)</h3> <p>SchNet<d-cite key="SchNet"></d-cite> is one of the pioneering GNN-based MLIPs. Introduced by Schütt et al., it was the first popular implicit MLIP model, a concept that all major models still more or less employ today. Its release initiated a paradigm shift in the field, resulting in the gradual replacement of handcrafted methods like GAP<d-cite key="GAP"></d-cite> by end-to-end fully learnable architectures.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/schnet_architecture-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/schnet_architecture-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/schnet_architecture-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/schnet_architecture.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">SchNet architecture overview. CFConvs make the surface smooth; the use of distances makes the model invariant to rotations<d-cite key="SchNet"></d-cite>.</figcaption> </figure> <h4 id="invariance-to-e3">Invariance to E(3)</h4> <p>SchNet is invariant to rotations, translations, and atomic indexing, which made it a significant step forward compared to previous models. Translation equivariance and atomic indexing symmetry are the easiest to achieve, as they often come naturally when working with graphs; which is why, going forward, we will only focus on rotational equivariance.</p> <p>SchNet achieves rotational equivariance by using the distance $d_{ij} = ||r_i - r_j||_2$ between two atoms $i$ and $j$ as input to the model, an operation <em>invariant</em> to rotations. These distances are then transformed into coefficients of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs),</p> <p>\(e_k(d_{ij}) = \exp(-\gamma (d_{ij} - \mu_k)^2) \quad\text{with}\quad k \in [1, K],\) where $\mu_k$ are the Gaussian centers, a fix for the high variance of the distance variable slightly resembling Fourier Features<d-cite key="tancik2020fourier"></d-cite>, which are then used further downstream for the update step.</p> <p>The update step is a simple convolution with ResNet<d-cite key="he2015resnet"></d-cite> skip-connections over neighboring atoms,</p> \[v_i^{(k+1)} = v_i^{(k)} + (v^{(k)} \ast W^{k}) = v_i^{(k)} + \sum_{j \neq i} W^{k}(d_{ij}) v_j^{(k)},\] <p>weighted by a learned function $W(d_{ij})$ of the inter-atomic distances. But newer models no longer take distances alone as model input, due to the fact that they underrepresent atomic systems especially when the model has fewer interaction layers. Only measuring distance can lead to having different atomic systems that result in the same prediction, even though they exert different forces and energies.</p> <h4 id="continuous-filter-convolutions">Continuous Filter Convolutions</h4> <p>A major challenge for applying convolutions in MLIPs is the irregular and sparse arrangement of neighboring atoms. This contrasts with CNNs for images, where pixels form a regular grid and the discretization is fine enough to make reasonable predictions. For MLIPs, a discrete convolution kernel analogous to those in CNNs results in a poorly discretized, discontinuous PES. SchNet addresses this problem by introducing CFConv layers. Instead of using a discrete kernel matrix, this method learns a \emph{continuous kernel function}. First, the distance between two atoms $d_{ij}$ is expanded using a set of RBF as shown above. Then, the resulting vector is processed by a small MLP to generate a filter weight $W(d_{ij})$:</p> \[W(d_{ij}) = \text{MLP}(e_1(d_{ij}), e_2(d_{ij}), \dots, e_K(d_{ij})).\] <p>This technique of generating filter weights from interatomic distances results in a smooth PES, as illustrated below.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/schnet_discrete_continuous-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/schnet_discrete_continuous-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/schnet_discrete_continuous-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/schnet_discrete_continuous.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Discrete convolution kernels result in a low-resolution PES, while continuous convolution filters lead to a smooth one<d-cite key="SchNet"></d-cite>.</figcaption> </figure> <h3 id="nequip-2022">NequIP (2022)</h3> <p>NequIP<d-cite key="batzner2022e3nequip"></d-cite> from Batzner et al. were the first to fully embrace the work from Tensor Field Networks (2018)<d-cite key="thomas2018tensor"></d-cite> efficiently. Instead of using just a few equivariant operations, they employ full SO(3) tensor products using the e3nn<d-cite key="geiger2022e3nn,thomas2018tensor,weiler20183dsteerablecnns,kondor2018clebschgordannets,e3nn_software"></d-cite> python library. Nvidia has since released <em>cuEquivariance</em><d-cite key="cuEquivariance"></d-cite>, essentially a GPU-accelerated version of <em>e3nn</em>.</p> <p>The key idea is to project the directional information onto spherical harmonics \(Y_m^{(l)}(\hat{r}_{ij})\), which are rotationally equivariant. These spherical harmonics are then multiplied with a learnable radial function \(R(r_{ij})\)</p> \[S_m^{(l)}(\hat{r}_{ij}) = R(r_{ij}) Y_m^{(l)}(\hat{r}_{ij}),\] <p>to form a convolutional filter similar to SchNet’s CFConv layers. In their experiments they found that using $l=0$ for the spherical harmonics (i.e. rotational invariance) yielded significantly worse results than using $l=1$ or $l=2$, but increasing $l$ further didn’t improve results much more.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/nequip_architecture-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/nequip_architecture-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/nequip_architecture-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/nequip_architecture.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">NequIP architecture overview.

They use a denoising diffusion objective similar to DDPMs for pretraining on equilibrium structures, and then fine-tune on forces and energies as described by Zaidi et al.<d-cite key="zaidi2022pretraining"></d-cite>. This makes the model not only more data efficient, but also results in significantly faster inference times, as it doesn’t use a computationally expensive equivariant architecture. Harcombe et al.<d-cite key="harcombe2025ontheconnection"></d-cite> reported that their diffusion models needed 50% less training data to reach the same accuracy as their non-diffusion models that also don’t respect symmetries in their experiments. Even though symmetry-agnostic diffusion models are more data efficient and are arguably more accurate for relaxation tasks, normal NNPs typically yield better force RMSE values.</p> <p>Orb-v2 is one of the fastest SOTA MLIP models, primarily due to its highly simple architecture and relatively small amount of parameters. It avoids loops and is therefore highly vectorizable, allowing for highly efficient batching and parallelization on modern hardware and uses torch-scatter<d-cite key="paszke2019pytorch"></d-cite> for message aggregation, which supports compilation via TorchScript<d-cite key="devito2023torchscript"></d-cite>. They provide models pretrained on the MPtrj dataset<d-cite key="deng2023mptrj"></d-cite>.</p> <h3 id="esen-2025">eSEN (2025)</h3> <p>The eSEN model from Fu et al.

It is a conservative MLIP that employs a novel SO(2) equivariant architecture, which avoids e3nn tensor products<d-cite key="geiger2022e3nn"></d-cite>, while still being equivariant to rotations.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/esen_architecture-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/esen_architecture-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/esen_architecture-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/esen_architecture.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">eSEN architecture overview: Faster SO(2) convolutions emerge naturally when only one degree of freedom remains<d-cite key="fu2025esen"></d-cite>.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The first key idea is to remove all but one degree of freedom in the message passing step. Generally, with one atom fixed at the center of the coordinate system, the other atom has three degrees of freedom to the first atom left, prompting a full SO(3) equivariant architecture. Zitnick et al.<d-cite key="zitnick2022sphericalchannelsmodelingatomic"></d-cite> however rotate the coordinate system such that atom $j$ lies on the positive z-axis, removing two more degrees of freedom.

The message network still sees the spherical channels displayed relative to its frame of reference and can therefore still make out relative information of its neighbors – but only has to learn this with one varying degree of freedom, the azimuthal angle $\theta$ around the z-axis, which $f_{\text{message}}$ needs to smoothly convolve over.

Even though most researchers prefer GROMACS<d-cite key="bekker1993gromacs,abraham2015gromacs"></d-cite> or LAMMPS<d-cite key="thompson2022lamps"></d-cite> for maturity, speed and their community, ASE’s simplicity and the fact that it is written in Python makes it the preferred choice for machine learning (ML) researchers, as most models are also written in Python. The key strength of ASE is the <em>calculator</em> interface, a universal interface that takes as input an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ase.Atoms</code> object containing the atomic positions, species, cell vectors and boundary conditions of the system, and outputs the computed potential energy and forces acting on each atom. Optionally, they can choose to calculate other properties like stress for NPT simulations or charges for electrostatic interactions. This allows ASE to integrate potentials and dynamics from the vast majority of MD frameworks, simply by implementing this interface<d-cite key="ase_calculator_docs"></d-cite> for their software. Additionally, ASE comes with a DFT calculator interface out of the box: the Grid-based Projector-Augmented Wave (GPAW) package<d-cite key="gpaw2024"></d-cite>. This allows for easy and frictionless switching between different potentials from empirical to DFT, allowing for easy benchmarking and evaluation of different MLIP models.</p> <h3 id="integrating-mlips-into-ase">Integrating MLIPs into ASE</h3> <p>The overwhelming majority of MLIP models provide a ready-to-use interface for ASE in the form of a calculator<d-cite key="ase_calculator_docs"></d-cite> class<d-cite key="rhodes2025orbv3,batzner2022e3nequip,wood2025uma,yang2024mattersim"></d-cite>. Because ASE is written in Python, and it’s abstaining from performing complicated domain decomposition, the integration of MLIP models is very straightforward, and an example implementation is available in the general addenda. After linking the <em>calculator</em> described in the ASE section, ASE calls the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calculate</code> method and fetches the computed properties as required.</p> <h3 id="lammps">LAMMPS</h3> <p>LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) is a highly scalable and parallelizable MD simulation framework leveraging empirical and classical potentials<d-cite key="thompson2022lamps"></d-cite>. It uses domain decomposition to distribute the workload of spatial domains to different workers<d-cite key="plimpton1995fast"></d-cite>. This allows systems with millions of atoms to be simulated efficiently, even on longer time scales, making it a frequent choice for researchers in material science.</p> <p><strong>Packages.</strong> A key strength of LAMMPS is its matured ecosystem of around 60 different <em>packages</em><d-cite key="lammps_packages_docs"></d-cite>, that extend the core functionality to meet a wide variety of demands. These packages can optionally be compiled along with the core software and provide ad-hoc functionality to the user. They rarely interact with each other and can often be used independently, making for a highly modular software. Examples include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KSPACE</code> with a long range electrostatic solver like particle-particle particle-mesh (PPPM)<d-cite key="eastwood1980p3m3dp"></d-cite>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KOKKOS</code> package for compilation of established styles<d-footnote>property computations</d-footnote> to CUDA kernels<d-cite key="edwards2014kokkos,trott2022kokkos3"></d-cite>, and the Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (ML-IAP) package for interfacing MLIPs, as described later in the ML-IAP usage section.</p> <h3 id="integrating-mlips-into-lammps">Integrating MLIPs into LAMMPS</h3> <p>As of writing this blog post, integrating MLIP models into LAMMPS is still a complicated and tedious task. There are two big roadblocks one will encounter for all integration pathways:</p> <h4 id="programming-language-gap">Programming language gap.</h4> <p>Even though the overwhelming majority of LAMMPS is written in C++, the overwhelming majority of ML models are written in Python, and not all of them use the same framework: Some researchers use PyTorch<d-cite key="paszke2019pytorch"></d-cite> for its unmatched flexibility and ease of use, while others might prefer to use JAX<d-cite key="jax2018github"></d-cite> from Google for its superior performance. So either one ports the entire model into C++ using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.jit.compile</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jax.jit</code> or by herself; or she creates a bridge between the two languages using Cython and Numpy as C++ array interface for Python code.</p> <p>The first option, Python to C++ compilation, is definitely faster and easier to use, provided it does actually compile. For example, when trying to port the <em>Orb model</em><d-cite key="rhodes2025orbv3"></d-cite> using TorchScript<d-cite key="paszke2019pytorch"></d-cite>, it failed to compile almost all the model’s submodules due to unsupported python operations like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*kwargs</code> arguments and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Optional[]</code> types, which are non-trivial to remove in a large codebase in a limited time-frame. Also, this particular model family makes use of an adaptive graph construction scheme, which also seems to clash with TorchScript.</p> <p>A C++-Python bridge is naturally slower, but framework-agnostic and significantly more versatile, given one has time and expertise to write the complicated cython interface, which is often non-trivial and must be done with the utmost care to avoid memory leaks and segmentation faults.</p> <h4 id="different-force-philosophies">Different force philosophies.</h4> <p>LAMMPS is primarily built around the idea of pair styles or pair potentials<d-cite key="lammps_packages_docs"></d-cite>. Pair potentials don’t immediately compute the per-atom force $F_{i}$ at-once, they compute intermediate forces \(F_{ij} = f(r_{ij}, \dots)\) <em>between</em> two atoms $i$ and $j$, usually as a function of their distance $r_{ij}$ first. Then they sum up all pairwise forces per atom, resulting in the overall force on an atom $i$<d-cite key="lammps_pair_to_overall_force_rule"></d-cite>: \(F_{i} = \sum_{j} F_{ij}\)</p> \[F_{j} = \sum_{i} - F_{ij}\] <p>While this approach is mostly reasonable for most empirical potentials, MLIPs are designed to output the overall per-atom forces $F_{i}$ directly or as a gradient of the potential energy $U$ with respect to the atomic positions $r_{i}$: And that is not just a different design philosophy, it is the very reason why MLIPs are as accurate as they are. They should ideally operate holistically in the atoms’ neighborhood, \(F_{i} = f(\{r_{ij}, r_{ik}, \dots\}, \dots)\) instead of focussing just on pairwise interactions that fail to capture important many-body effects like angular dependencies (e.g. in H<sub>2</sub>O). Here, $j, k \in N(i)$ denotes all neighbors of atom $i$. To bridge this gap, two options make themselves available: In the philosophy of GDML from Chmiela et al.<d-cite key="chmiela2017mlff"></d-cite>, one can task implicit (conservative) models to output pairwise forces<d-cite key="nequip_lammps_autograd_integration"></d-cite> as a gradient of the potential energy $U$ with respect to the inter-atomic distance vector $r_{ij}$: \(F_{ij} = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial r_{ij}} \cdot \frac{r_{ij}}{||r_{ij}||}\) which allows one to apply them in the pairwise force philosophy of LAMMPS. Only a handful of models offer support for this type of readout, as it adds computational overhead and integrational complexity, and they only do this to support LAMMPS<d-cite key="nequip_lammps_autograd_integration"></d-cite>. Not only is conformity to pair forces tedious and must be redone for every model, it can result in <em>significant</em> performance degradation. Packages in LAMMPS generally expect pairwise potentials to be fairly inexpensive, and will not shy away from calling pair potentials as often as they like, in the extreme case once per atom per step<d-cite key="lammps_gcmc_spam_calling_pair_potential"></d-cite>, which will – provided the model lacks a smart caching strategy – result in a slowdown of the already quite expensive grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) step in the worst-case by a factor of $N$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the system. The other possibility is to modify LAMMPS’s core to allow for direct per-atom forces, which is not trivial and requires at least some knowledge of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++</code> and LAMMPS’s internal workings.</p> <h4 id="option-1-new-lammps-package">Option 1: New LAMMPS package</h4> <p>The most complicated, time-consuming and redundant way of integrating MLIPs into LAMMPS is the creation of a new package that provides a custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pair_style</code>. This would require writing a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pair_style</code> class in C++ that interfaces with our MLIP models, either via C++-Python bridge or by porting the model to C++ as discussed earlier in the programming language gap section.</p> <p>While this is by far the most flexible option with the highest level of control, it requires the most interation with LAMMPS’s core codebase, is the most time-consuming and might need additional maintenance in the future. Popular models like MACE<d-cite key="batatia2022mace"></d-cite> were directly ported into C++ and given a custom package<d-cite key="integrating_mace_into_lammps"></d-cite>. Even though it can be the faster option in terms of MD throughput on the CPU, porting a model requires a lot of work from experts in both C++ and the respective MLIP framework; a process which is not always possible, not guaranteed to offer the best performance and rarely graphics processing unit (GPU) compatible out-of-the-box. All-in-all, this option didn’t seem general, realistic or time-efficient enough for our purposes.</p> <h4 id="option-2-the-ml-iap-package">Option 2: The ML-IAP package</h4> <p>To provide a universal interface for MLIP models, the ML-IAP package was added to LAMMPS in 2020. It uses a cython C++ to Python bridge to interface with Python code, allowing for on-the-fly integration of models without the need for a port. To integrate a brand-new MLIP model into LAMMPS when acting through python, one can either specify a loaded python module inheriting from the abstract <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MLIAPUnifiedInterface</code> class performing the model invocation, or specify a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pt</code> file containing such conforming model serialized by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.save</code>. This means that at the time of writing, one can not load a JAX model from a file, although support for it is underway<d-cite key="githublampsjaxpulldraft"></d-cite>. Again, this operation does not compile the model into C++; instead it just serializes the model weights and architecture into a Python pickle file. A schematic overview of the standard, indented ML-IAP integration is shown below.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-mliap-integration-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-mliap-integration-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-mliap-integration-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-mliap-integration.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Block diagram showing the ML-IAP integration pipeline" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Integrating MLIPs via ML-IAP into LAMMPS. Blue means written in Python, yellow means written in C++.</figcaption> </figure> <p>A big shortcoming of the provided cython bridge is the absence of absolute atomic positions. One is just given the pairwise distance vectors, which are often not enough. Not only do almost all models expect to receive absolute atomic positions, some model families like Orb<d-cite key="rhodes2025orbv3,neumann2024orbv2"></d-cite> actually require them for efficient graph construction. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ML-IAP</code> package typically expects the model to output the pairwise forces $F_{ij}$ instead of the overall per-atom forces $F_{i}$, as discussed in the different force philosophies section above. This means that one either folds and rewrites the model to conformity like NequIP<d-cite key="batzner2022e3nequip,tan2025high"></d-cite> did<d-cite key="nequip_lammps_autograd_integration"></d-cite>, or the package is modified and the complicated compilation process that comes with that.</p> <h4 id="option-3-metatomic">Option 3: Metatomic</h4> <p>In search for integration alternatives, the recent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Metatomic</code><d-cite key="metatomic"></d-cite> project by Filippo Bigi et al. <d-cite key="bigi2025metatomic"></d-cite> was a promising option. It aims to provide a universal MLIP model interface for not only LAMMPS, but also ASE, GROMACS<d-cite key="bekker1993gromacs,abraham2015gromacs"></d-cite>, the path-integral molecular dynamics driver i-PI<d-cite key="ipi3"></d-cite> and many other frameworks, meaning that once a model is compatible with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Metatomic</code>, it can be used seamlessly in all supported frameworks without any additional work.</p> <h4 id="discussing-the-options">Discussing the Options</h4> <p>Option 3 would have been the most elegant, future-proof and helpful solution. so it was naturally considered first. The primary downside is a C++ porting requirement with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.jit.compile</code>, neither always possible for torch models, nor applicable to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JAX</code> models like Nequix<d-cite key="koker2025nequix"></d-cite>. Option 1 was clearly a last resort in case the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ML-IAP</code> package would turn out unpatchable, which left us only with option 2, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ML-IAP</code> package.</p> <h4 id="modifying-lammps">Modifying LAMMPS</h4> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ML-IAP</code> already had access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atoms-&gt;x</code> array naturally, but didn’t provide it to the cython interface. To give the python code access, a pointer to the position array <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atom-&gt;x</code> was added to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MLIAPData</code> class, which is then wrapped by a cython interface class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MLIAPDataPy</code> which one can then use in python. For an efficient and zero-copy transfer of the C++ array to python, numpy<d-cite key="harris2020numpy"></d-cite> is used as an interface. The only problem was that C++ arrays don’t carry information about their length, as they are just pointers to the first element in memory. So we looked for a variable in LAMMPS that would provide us with the number of atoms in the system, which sounds easy but was anything but. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atoms-&gt;ntotal</code> exists, but this number varies over time, even with the same number of atoms as input, due to – which took some figuring out – the presence of <em>ghost atoms</em>. LAMMPS uses so-called ghost atoms for inter-worker communication, allowing the simulation of larger systems via domain decomposition as described by Plimpton<d-cite key="plimpton1995fast"></d-cite>.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-ghost-atoms-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-ghost-atoms-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-ghost-atoms-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-ghost-atoms.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Ghost atoms in LAMMPS enable periodic boundary conditions" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Ghost atoms in LAMMPS are used to simulate periodic boundary conditions.</figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-atoms-memory-layout-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-atoms-memory-layout-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-atoms-memory-layout-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-atoms-memory-layout.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Memory layout for atom-&gt;x and atom-&gt;f arrays" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Memory layout of `atom-&gt;x` and `atom-&gt;f`, with local atoms first and ghost atoms appended.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>so it wasn’t exactly clear what type of atom can be found at what position in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atoms-&gt;x</code> array. After some digging through the LAMMPS source code and some trial-and-error, two facts became clear: Both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atom-&gt;x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atom-&gt;f</code> contain the positions and forces of <em>all atoms</em>, local and ghost. Secondly, the arrays start with local atoms, directly followed by all ghost atoms as illustrated in the memory-layout panel above. We use all atoms, local and ghost as input to our MLIPs, because ghost atoms too can exert forces on real atoms as shown in the ghost-atom schematic above. We only apply the predicted forces to our local atoms, and postulate that if there exists a ghost atom, it is updated by <em>exactly the same</em> force predictor. This is important to ensure that Newton’s third law holds, i.e. that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. As was learned only later, LAMMPS uses ghost atoms not only for inter-worker communication, but also to simulate periodic boundary conditions, just like in the earlier illustration. Models are informed that the system is non-periodic and the rest is handled by LAMMPS automatically. This also means that models that previously didn’t support periodic boundary conditions, now do. Additionally, if one is not interested in the stress tensor, the original cell can simply be replaced by a large cubic cell, which we did for simplicity and to avoid any potential issues with out-of-cell atoms. We recognize that this solution requires the MLIP to compute more interactions than strictly necessary, resulting in an overhead of approximately 20-30%. Future work could focus on adding support for periodic boundary conditions naturally, ignoring ghost atoms. For this purpose, cell and boundary information has also been made available in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MLIAPData</code> class.</p> <h4 id="all-roads-lead-to-ase">All roads lead to ASE</h4> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-universal-ase-adapter-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-universal-ase-adapter-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-universal-ase-adapter-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/lammps-universal-ase-adapter.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Universal ASE adapter for ML-IAP integration" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Building a universal ASE adapter for LAMMPS ML-IAP integration.

Note that only the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">real</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metal</code> LAMMPS units are supported.

To reduce variance of measurements caused by startup tasks like JIT compilation, a 40-step warm-up is performed on a system of 5 atoms. Then, we measure the inference speed of MLIPs on systems of 10, 100, 1.000, 10.000, and 100.000 atoms. We repeat the measurements a total of 20 times for each system size and model, and discard the first measurement to reduce size-depended startup tasks found in models like Orb-v3<d-cite key="rhodes2025orbv3"></d-cite>. To take caching out of the equation, no atomic systems were reused. While <d-cite key="rhodes2025orbv3"></d-cite> report up to 40\% performance gains from reducing neighbor limits of Orb-v3 to 20, we assume that any practical application will always prefer to avoid neighbor limits to reduce the risk of energy drift and instabilities in long-running MD simulations. We use an AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 5975WX 32-Core processor with 256GB of RAM for CPU inference and a NVIDIA® H100 NVL® GPU with 100GB of VRAM for GPU inference. When possible, all models were compiled using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.compile</code> through ASE calculator options and for JAX models using JAX’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jit</code> compilation.</p> <p>All models exhibit <em>linear scaling</em> with respect to the system size, meaning that MLIPs have the same computational complexity class as empirical force fields. Simulating a system twice as large simply requires twice the resources or double the time, which is not the case for any ab-initio method and a major advantage of MLIPs. However, the fact that all models scale linearly on the CPU and GPU does not mean that they are equally fast in practice. Using a GPU for inference results in speedups two orders of magnitude, as long as the system is larger than about 1.000 atoms. Inference times for smaller systems are bottlenecked by the general overhead and data transfer to and from the GPU. So for applications like high-throughput screening batching smaller systems to a single, clustered system can improve throughput by a large margin. Even though a single MD run can’t be batched due to its sequential nature, independent parallel-running MD simulations of smaller systems can be batched together and benefit. But not only the GPU has a large effect on the linear factor: Orb-v3 Direct predicts forces of 100.000 atoms as fast as UMA can predict the forces of only about 2.000 atoms. So even though in theory all models scale linearly with system size, O(N); the actual inference speed is model dependent. Explicit models without an equivariant architecture like Orb-v2 and direct Orb-v3 run the fastest. Even with more parameters than Orb-v2 and a higher neighbor limit, Orb-v3 ends up being slightly faster due to reduced overhead of edge aggregation and message passing of 10 layers fewer<d-cite key="rhodes2025orbv3"></d-cite>. On third place is Nequix, that is both implicit and uses the tensor products of e3nn<d-cite key="geiger2022e3nn"></d-cite> for equivariance, but has a relatively small number of parameters and uses JAX instead of PyTorch.</p> <p>In the following table we converted the raw inference speed into a more intuitive unit of nanoseconds per day (ns/day), assuming that a simulation is run with a time step of 1 fs ($10^{-15}$ s). This is a more common unit to express simulation speeds in the MD community, as it intuitively relates to how much simulation time can be covered in a day of wall-clock time.</p> <div class="table-responsive"> <table class="table table-sm table-borderless"> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th>10 atoms</th> <th>100 atoms (↓)</th> <th>1,000 atoms</th> <th>10,000 atoms</th> <th>100,000 atoms</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Orb-v3 Direct</td> <td><strong>16.14</strong></td> <td><strong>15.55</strong></td> <td><strong>8.95</strong></td> <td><strong>1.29</strong></td> <td><strong>0.08</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Orb-v2</td> <td>11.57</td> <td>11.04</td> <td>6.79</td> <td>0.92</td> <td>0.06</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nequix</td> <td>12.00</td> <td>8.91</td> <td>2.41</td> <td>0.25</td> <td>--</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Orb-v3 Conservative</td> <td>7.46</td> <td>7.00</td> <td>3.15</td> <td>0.36</td> <td>--</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MatterSim v1</td> <td>5.40</td> <td>5.10</td> <td>2.84</td> <td>0.41</td> <td>--</td> </tr> <tr> <td>SevenNet MF-ompa</td> <td>1.82</td> <td>1.51</td> <td>0.51</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> </tr> <tr> <td>eSEN OAM</td> <td>1.40</td> <td>1.19</td> <td>0.24</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> </tr> <tr> <td>UMA M</td> <td>0.78</td> <td>0.84</td> <td>0.16</td> <td>0.01</td> <td>--</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="caption"> Inference speeds in ns/day for different models and system sizes on a single H100 GPU, sorted by inference speed for 100 atoms.

They consist of metal nodes (ions or clusters) connected by organic linkers, resulting in a highly porous structure with an enormous internal surface area. For example, a single gram of MOF-5 has a surface area of 2900 m$^2$<d-cite key="furukawa2013chemistry"></d-cite>, which is roughly equivalent to the area of half a soccer field. These features, among others, make MOFs particular interesting for gas storage and separation applications. Specifically, Mg-MOF-74<d-footnote>Aka. CPO-27-Mg or Mg$_2$(DOBDC), DOBDC = 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid<d-cite key="xiao2019mof74"></d-cite></d-footnote> is of particular interest to the scientific community for its excellent carbon-dioxide adsorption<d-cite key="degaga2022quantum"></d-cite>.</p> <p>CO$_2$ is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for climate change<d-cite key="ipcc2021climate, houghton2004global, mann1998global, lovelock2006"></d-cite>, so materials that can efficiently capture and store carbon-dioxide<d-cite key="ipcc2022ccs, sumida2012carbon, li2011carbon"></d-cite> could play a critical role reversing pollution and its effects. MOFs can also be used to store other gasses like methane and hydrogen<d-cite key="chen2020balancing"></d-cite>, making them versatile materials for various gas storage applications. Having fast and accurate potentials to simulate CO$_2$ adsorption in different MOF structures could greatly accelerate the discovery of new materials for carbon capture applications via HTS. The goal is to benchmark different MLIP models on their ability to simulate carbon-dioxide adsorption in Mg-MOF-74, compared to empirical potentials. The two primary forces acting on the CO$_2$ molecules in the MOF are VdW forces and electrostatic forces<d-cite key="sumida2012carbon"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Electrostatic interactions</strong> are fundamental forces between charged particles and play a critical role in a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes. These forces can be modelled with Coulomb’s law<d-cite key="griffiths1999introduction"></d-cite>, which describes the potential interaction energy between two point charges in a vacuum as</p> \[E_{\text{elec}} = \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r}\] <p>where $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are the charges of the interacting particles, $r$ is their separation distance, and $\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space. The $1/r$ dependence of electrostatic interactions makes them exceptionally long-ranged, meaning they cannot be neglected even at distances exceeding 25 Å. In our MOF example, the interaction energy between the $Mg^{2+}$ metal node ($q\approx1.45e$<d-cite key="fu2023solvent"></d-cite>) in Mg-MOF-74 and the carbon atom of a CO$_2$ molecule ($q\approx0.7e$<d-cite key="fu2023solvent"></d-cite>) at a distance of 15 Å remains 0.9710 eV (141 kJ/mol). The corresponding Coulomb force, which decays with a factor of $1/r^2$, is still 1.07 eV/Å (103 kJ/mol), a non-negligible value. Nevertheless, MLIPs often restrict their ‘‘receptive field’’ to only a few Ångströms primarily for performance – typically 6–10 Å<d-cite key="rhodes2025orbv3, neumann2024orbv2"></d-cite>. Capturing such long-range interactions would solely rely on message-passing propagation, a process that would require the atoms to be connected through a chain of neighbors. This can be particularly challenging in porous materials like MOFs, where the MOF atoms are dense (meaning neighborhood limits are quickly reached) and often far apart from the gas molecules (cutoff distances are easily exceeded).</p> <p><strong>Van-der-Waals interactions</strong> are the other primary force acting on CO$_2$ molecules in Mg-MOF-74, and as discussed in the Kohn-Sham section they require dispersion corrections to be modelled accurately in DFT simulations. The effects of VdW forces fall off with $1/r^{6}$ and are therefore rather short-ranged compared to electrostatic interactions. While some models like Orb-v3<d-cite key="rhodes2025orbv3"></d-cite> include dispersion corrections directly in their inference pipeline, it is possible to add dispersion corrections as a post-processing step to any MLIP model. In ASE this can be quickly done by jointly adding both model calculator and a dispersion calculator (like d3 for example) to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SumCalculator</code> object that simply sums the energies and forces of both calculators. Contrasting the need for a post-processing correction, the UMA model family<d-cite key="wood2025uma"></d-cite> is directly trained on various dispersion-corrected datasets, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OMol25</code><d-cite key="levine2025omol25, uma_huggingface_demo"></d-cite>. This means that UMA has learned to capture dispersion interactions directly from data, without the need for an explicit dispersion correction.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/mof-74-mg-structure-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/mof-74-mg-structure-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/mof-74-mg-structure-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-mlip-practical/mof-74-mg-structure.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Structure of Mg-MOF-74: Red, cyan, grey, and white spheres represent oxygen, magnesium, carbon, and hydrogen atoms<d-cite key="degaga2022quantum"></d-cite>.</figcaption> </figure> <p>To benchmark MLIPs in a realistic setup, we simulate the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> in Mg-MOF-74 via MD simulations.

Because they make use of LAMMPS for their GCMC simulation, the need for a MLIP bridge emerged which was discussed earlier. A GCMC simulation is basically just a normal MD simulation with the structure fixed, with one additional step: every few MD steps, a molecule – in our case CO<sub>2</sub> – is either inserted or deleted from the system based on the chemical potential and temperature. This allows the system to equilibrate with a gas reservoir at a given pressure and temperature, simulating the adsorption process accurately. We simulate 10 different pressure settings from 0 to 1 bar at 300K each for 3,000,000 MD steps with a timestep of 2 fs.

We observed the density plots of the CO$_2$ atoms inside the MOF structure, where we can see the wave-like patterns originating from the magnesium ions at the corners of the MOF predicted by the empirical model, with a slight resemblance of this pattern in the Orb-v3 direct-force results. Additionally, the GCMC algorithm sometimes inserts CO$_2$ molecules directly into the MOF structure itself for some unknown reason, which might have a negative effect on the results generally. In the figures above we show the adsorption isotherms predicted by the empirical model (left) and the Orb-v3 direct-force omol model (right), how many CO$_2$ molecules stay in the GCMC simulation at different pressures. While the empirical model predicts a logarithmic increase in adsorbed CO$_2$ molecules with increasing pressure, the Orb-v3 direct-force omol model predicts a constant number of adsorbed CO$_2$ molecules for all pressure settings. We fit the Langmuir adsorption model<d-cite key="langmuir1917adsorption"></d-cite></p> \[q = \frac{q_{\text{max}} b P}{1 + b P}\] <p>to both isotherms, where $q$ is the amount adsorbed at pressure $P$, $q_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum adsorption capacity, and $b$ is a constant related to the affinity of the adsorbent for the adsorbate. This model is plotted as a dashed line in the adsorption isotherm figure, showing a good fit for the empirical results while the Orb-v3 direct-force omol model predicts almost no pressure-related correlation for CO$_2$ adsorption. Finally, we plot the number of CO$_2$ molecules inside the GCMC simulation over time for different pressure settings in the figure above. While the empirical model shows a small variation in the number of CO$_2$ molecules over unique pressure-dependent mean values over time, the results obtained from the Orb-v3 direct-force omol model seem random with a high variance without any pressure-dependent mean value. A potential area of future work could be the evaluation – with the necessary computational resources at hand – of more models or orb-v3 variations to find better performing models for this task.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In this post, we explored how MLIPs work and how they are built, different architectures and design choices that go into making them. We were successful in building a universal ASE-MLIP interface for LAMMPS, allowing us to run an originally empirical Mg-MOF-74 CO$_2$-adsorption GCMC simulation with a MLIP instead, only to discover that it doesn’t reproduce the more physically-sound empirical results. While we were able to evaluate the cheapest MLIP model on the CO$_2$ GCMC simulation, the more accurate models were simply too expensive to run in a reasonable time frame.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/2026/assets/bibliography/2026-04-27-mlip-practical.bib"></d-bibliography> <d-article> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/fans/">FANS - Frequency-Adaptive Noise Shaping for Diffusion Models</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/why-vlms-waste-their-vision/">Why vlms waste their vision</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/wait-do-we-need-to-wait/">Wait, Do We Need to Wait?
