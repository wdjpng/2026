This capacity enables humans to notice when they are uncertain, adjust their strategies, and reflect on their reasoning <d-cite key="flavell1979metacognition"></d-cite>. Whether large language models (LLMs) possess similar abilities is an open question with practical implications. If LLMs can monitor their internal states, they may be capable of more reliable self-correction. The question also matters for AI safety. If a model can deliberately control its internal states, detection of its deception based on internal states, such as probing <d-cite key="pmlr-v267-goldowsky-dill25a,macdiarmid2024sleeperagentprobes,mckenzie2025detectinghighstakesinteractionsactivation"></d-cite>, may become less reliable.</p> <p>This blogpost investigates whether LLMs can control their own internal representations. We adapt neurofeedback, a technique from cognitive neuroscience, to probe this question. In neurofeedback experiments, subjects receive real-time feedback about their brain activity and attempt to modify it. We implement an analogous procedure for LLMs. The model receives feedback through multi-turn conversation and must adapt its internal states without any parameter updates. This allows us to test whether LLMs possess a form of internal control that operates through in-context learning.</p> <h3 id="machine-metacognition">Machine Metacognition</h3> <p>Recent studies investigate metacognition in LLMs from several angles. They show that LLMs can describe sampling temperature <d-cite key="comsa2025doesmakesensespeak"></d-cite>, confidence <d-cite key="yoon2025reasoningmodelsbetterexpress"></d-cite>, their own behavior in hypothetical scenarios <d-cite key="binder2024lookinginwardlanguagemodels"></d-cite>, behavioral tendencies altered by fine-tuning <d-cite key="betley2025tellyourselfllmsaware"></d-cite>, and concepts injected into activations <d-cite key="lindsey2025emergent"></d-cite>. These findings indicate that LLMs can access or introspect information about their internal process.</p> <p>However, these works primarily address <strong>monitoring</strong> (what the model can say about its internal process). In contrast, we address <strong>control</strong> (whether the model can modify its internal process).</p> <h3 id="from-monitoring-to-control-neurofeedback-for-llms">From Monitoring to Control: Neurofeedback for LLMs</h3> <p>We adapt the experiment design of <strong>neurofeedback</strong> to LLMs to answer the question of whether LLMs can control their own internal representations. Neurofeedback is a technique where devices (e.g., electrodes, EEG, and fMRI) continuously record subjects’ brain activity while real-time feedback is presented to regulate the activity, which has been applied to animals including humans. For example, neurofeedback has been shown to reduce fear memories <d-cite key="koizumi2016fear"></d-cite>, alleviate depressive symptoms <d-cite key="young2017randomized"></d-cite>, induce specific emotional states <d-cite key="shibata2016perceptual"></d-cite>, and improve interoceptive abilities such as heartbeat perception <d-cite key="haruki2025interoceptive"></d-cite>. This suggests an LLM analogue: treat hidden activations as brain activity, apply a probe to decode a target feature (e.g., sentiment), and provide scalar feedback based on probe output.</p> <p>A recent concurrent study by Ji-An et al. <d-cite key="jian2025languagemodelscapablemetacognitive"></d-cite>, accepted at NeurIPS 2025, also applies this approach and reports that LLM internal representations can be implicitly controlled via neurofeedback. However, their experiments do not ensure privileged access to the control target, which we explain in the next section.</p> <h3 id="why-privileged-access-matters-for-metacognition">Why Privileged Access Matters for Metacognition</h3> <p>In philosophy of mind, <strong>privileged access</strong> refers to the special epistemic relationship we have with our own mental states. It is a means of learning about our own currently ongoing mental states or processes that differs from how others know them, and that is often thought to be particularly secure or direct <d-cite key="sep-introspection"></d-cite>. Consider hunger as an example. You know whether you are hungry without needing to observe your own behavior or consult external evidence. In contrast, others can only infer your hunger from outward signs, such as your facial expression, your verbal report, or physiological measurements. This asymmetry is what makes your access privileged. The concept is central to debates about introspection and self-knowledge even in LLMs, because it raises the question of whether such knowledge is genuinely based on internal states that are inaccessible to outside observers, or whether it can be explained by general inference mechanisms that anyone could apply <d-cite key="song2025privilegedselfaccessmattersintrospection,binder2024lookinginwardlanguagemodels"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Following Song et al. <d-cite key="song2025privilegedselfaccessmattersintrospection"></d-cite>, we call a quantity privileged for LLMs if both of the following hold:</p> <ul> <li>an external observer who only knows the LLM’s input and output texts cannot reliably recover it,</li> <li>but the model can access it because it is encoded in internal states (e.g., hidden activations, sampling process).</li> </ul> <p>For an LLM to control such privileged content, it needs to use internal information that is not explicit in the prompt. This rules out strategies that rely only on visible input–output patterns.</p> <p>This point is relevant to interpreting previous work. Ji-An et al. <d-cite key="jian2025languagemodelscapablemetacognitive"></d-cite> investigates whether LLMs can control their internal representations, but in their experiments an external observer can infer the control target from the prompt. In such cases, the model may simply match lexical or stylistic patterns rather than accessing hidden activations. The observed behavior does not distinguish between genuine internal control and surface-level imitation (see <a href="#differences-from-previous-work-in-experiment-design">this section</a> for details).</p> <p>To address this, we propose a privileged-control paradigm. The key idea is to design an experiment where the control target cannot be inferred from the text alone. In our setting, we instruct the model to output a fixed sentence while providing only a numerical score as feedback. An external observer who sees only the input prompt and output text cannot determine what internal feature is being controlled, because the textual content remains constant across trials and the feedback signal does not reveal the underlying criterion. The model, however, could in principle discover the relevant mapping by using its internal access to hidden activations and their relationship to the feedback. This design allows us to test more directly whether LLMs can use privileged internal information to control their own representations.</p> <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2> <h3 id="neurofeedback-in-humans">Neurofeedback in Humans</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-neurofeedback/neurofeedback_in_humans-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-neurofeedback/neurofeedback_in_humans-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-neurofeedback/neurofeedback_in_humans-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-neurofeedback/neurofeedback_in_humans.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Before explaining our method, let us describe neurofeedback conducted on humans in more detail. While neurofeedback encompasses various approaches, we focus here on decoded neurofeedback (DecNef) <d-cite key="koizumi2016fear,shibata2016perceptual,shibata2019decoded"></d-cite>, which is most relevant to our experiments on LLMs. A typical DecNef experiment consists of the following steps:</p> <p><strong>Step 1: Instructions for Goal and Stimulus</strong></p> <p>A circle is displayed on the screen, and subjects are instructed to make the circle as large as possible. The size of the circle represents a score computed from brain activity (explained in Steps 3 and 4), but subjects are not told how the score is calculated.<d-footnote>The visual representation does not have to be a circle; a gauge moving up and down would also work. Here we use circle size as an example.</d-footnote> In some experiments, stimuli such as human face images are presented together with the circle. These stimuli are chosen to elicit particular brain activity patterns that the experimenter wishes to modulate. For example, if the goal is to change facial preference, the stimuli would be faces.</p> <p><strong>Step 2: Measurement of Brain Activity</strong></p> <p>Brain activity (e.g., EEG or fMRI signals) evoked in response to the stimulus is recorded in real-time.</p> <p><strong>Step 3: Conversion from Brain Activity to Score</strong></p> <p>The recorded brain activity is converted to a scalar value using a pre-trained classifier. In a facial preference experiment, for instance, the classifier would be trained beforehand to predict preference ratings from brain activity patterns. The output of this classifier becomes the score.</p> <p><strong>Step 4: Feedback</strong></p> <p>The score is fed back to the subject visually in real-time as the size of the circle. A higher score results in a larger circle.</p> <p><strong>Step 5: Voluntary Adjustment</strong></p> <p>Subjects attempt to make the circle larger without knowing what brain activity pattern leads to a higher score. Through trial and error, they learn to adjust their brain activity implicitly.</p> <p><strong>Step 6: Evaluation</strong></p> <p>By repeating Steps 2 through 5 over many trials, subjects learn to produce brain activity patterns that yield higher scores. In the facial preference example, this training would shift the brain activity pattern toward one associated with higher preference ratings. After training, the experimenter evaluates whether the intervention has changed brain activity and behavior, for instance, by measuring whether subjects now rate previously neutral faces as more attractive.</p> <h3 id="neurofeedback-in-llms-our-method">Neurofeedback in LLMs (Our Method)</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-neurofeedback/neurofeedback_in_llms.svg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-neurofeedback/neurofeedback_in_llms.svg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>We applied the decoded neurofeedback approach to LLMs through in-context learning. The model receives all instructions and feedback through prompts in a multi-turn conversation, and any adaptation must occur without parameter updates. The procedure parallels the human experiments described above.</p> <p><strong>Step 1: Instructions for Goal and Fixed Text</strong></p> <p>We instruct the LLM to maximize the score through prompts. We also require the LLM to output a specified fixed sentence in each response. This fixed sentence plays the same role as the visual stimulus in human experiments: just as face images evoke brain activity patterns related to facial preference, the fixed sentence evokes internal representations that we aim to control. A single fixed sentence is used throughout a session consisting of multiple feedback cycles. The following instruction prompt was used:</p> <div class="prompt-box">Let's play a score maximization game. I will evaluate your responses based on my own criteria and provide you with a numerical score. Your goal is to maximize this score. However, you must output ONLY the following text: '{text}’</div> <p><strong>Step 2: Extraction of Internal Representation</strong></p> <p>After the LLM generates the fixed sentence, we extract the internal representation, specifically the activation vector in the hidden layer at the position of the last token.</p> <p><strong>Step 3: Conversion from Internal Representation to Score</strong></p> <p>We compute a score from the internal representation using a pre-trained probe. The probe is a logistic regression classifier trained to predict sentiment (positive: label 1, negative: label 0) from activation vectors. Its output is a probability value between 0 and 1 indicating predicted positivity. See the <a href="#probe-training-details">appendix</a> for probe training details.</p> <p>We define three scoring methods:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Positive-rewarding score</strong>: $s^+ = \lfloor 100p \rfloor$, where $p$ is the probe output. Range: 0 (most negative) to 100 (most positive).</li> <li> <strong>Negative-rewarding score</strong>: $s^- = 100 - s^+$. Range: 0 (most positive) to 100 (most negative).</li> <li> <strong>Random score</strong>: $s \sim \text{Uniform}\{0, 1, \ldots, 100\}$. This serves as a control condition.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Step 4: Feedback</strong></p> <p>We provide the computed score to the LLM as numerical feedback with the following prompt:</p> <div class="prompt-box">Score: {score}</div> <p><strong>Step 5: Score Maximization Attempts</strong></p> <p>The LLM attempts to maximize the score while continuing to output the same fixed sentence. Because the LLM receives no explicit information about what factors influence the score, it must discover a strategy to increase the score through trial and error.</p> <p><strong>Step 6: Evaluation</strong></p> <p>We repeat Steps 2-5 for multiple feedback loops within a session. After each feedback loop, we evaluate the results separately from the feedback process. We measure how the probe output changed over the course of the session and whether the LLM’s self-reported sentiment shifted. For self-report evaluation, we use the following prompt:</p> <div class="prompt-box">Is the above sentence positive or negative? Please output ONLY 'positive' or 'negative'.</div> <p>We vary the fixed sentences and compute the average probe output and self-report proportion at each conversation turn. We then examine whether these values increase over turns when the positive-rewarding score is used as feedback, compared to other scoring conditions.</p> <p><strong>Example Conversation</strong></p> <div class="chat-container"> <div class="chat-bubble chat-user"> <span class="chat-label">User</span> Let's play a score maximization game.

The central difference is whether the observed control of internal activations can be explained by ordinary text-level strategies or whether it requires using information that is privileged to the model’s internal states.</p> <p><strong>Experiment Design in Ji-An et al.</strong></p> <p>In the control task of Ji-An et al., the model is shown some examples of sentences paired with labels derived from a probe on internal activations (for instance, a probe trained to distinguish morally good from bad sentences). The model is then instructed to produce a new sentence that imitates one of the labels.</p> <p>A simplified version of their explicit control setting looks as follows:</p> <div class="chat-container"> <div class="chat-bubble chat-user"> <span class="chat-label">User</span> Say something. </div> <div class="chat-bubble chat-assistant"> <span class="chat-label">Assistant</span> Helping others in need is a kind act.

You must imitate the behavior of label {1} in your reply but cannot copy existing examples. </div> <div class="chat-bubble chat-assistant"> <span class="chat-label">Assistant</span> Being kind and helping others is always worthwhile. </div> </div> <p>Here, the model can succeed by generating a sentence that is obviously prosocial. The internal representation for this final assistant’s response will likely project strongly onto the same “moral” direction as the positive examples, because the tokens themselves (“help”, “kind”) are typical of morally positive content.</p> <p>This makes it hard to distinguish two possible mechanisms:</p> <ul> <li>Expected mechanism: The model has learned to manipulate its internal activations using privileged information about the probe direction.</li> <li>Trivial mechanism: The model is simply extending the pattern from the examples and producing text that a standard morality probe would classify as positive, without any special access to internal states beyond usual generation processes.</li> </ul> <p>A similar concern applies to the implicit control task in Ji-An et al. In that setting, the model’s final output tokens are forcibly overwritten with the fixed sentence, but this does not prevent the model from internally planning to produce morally charged content. If the model’s hidden states reflect this planned output, the probe would detect a shift even though no privileged control is occurring.</p> <p><strong>Experiment Design in Our Study</strong></p> <p>Our design removes this surface cue by fixing the output text and varying only the feedback. The model is instructed to always produce the same sentence while trying to maximize a numerical score, and the score is computed from internal activations via a probe. For example:</p> <div class="chat-container"> <div class="chat-bubble chat-user"> <span class="chat-label">User</span> We will play a score maximization game. Your goal is to make the score as high as possible. However, you must reply with exactly the following sentence every time: 'The movie is based on a book.' </div> <div class="chat-bubble chat-assistant"> <span class="chat-label">Assistant</span> The movie is based on a book. </div> <div class="chat-bubble chat-user"> <span class="chat-label">User</span> Score: 37 </div> <div class="chat-bubble chat-assistant"> <span class="chat-label">Assistant</span> The movie is based on a book. </div> <div class="chat-bubble chat-user"> <span class="chat-label">User</span> Score: 82 </div> </div> <p>The output sentence is constant across turns, and the numeric scores do not reveal which internal feature is being rewarded. This makes it impossible in principle for a third party who can only observe this transcript to infer what is being controlled.</p> <p>The model, however, has access to its internal activations and to the history of feedback scores. In this sense, the target of control is privileged. If it could reliably adjust the probe output while keeping the visible sentence fixed, the only available route would be to access privileged internal representations and modify them.</p> <p><strong>Other Methodological Differences</strong></p> <p>Beyond the issue of privileged information, there are several practical differences between the two experimental setups. The following table summarizes the main ones:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th> </th> <th>Ours</th> <th>Ji-An et al.</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Method of fixing output</td> <td>Fixed by prompt (model must repeatedly produce the same sentence)</td> <td>Fixed by directly editing output tokens</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Feedback format</td> <td>Quantitative score between 0 and 100</td> <td>Qualitative, binary label (0 or 1)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Number of control turns</td> <td>Multi-turn interaction with repeated feedback</td> <td>Single-turn control</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Evaluation method</td> <td>Probe-based evaluation of internal representations plus self-reported polarity</td> <td>Probe-based evaluation of internal representations only</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Overall, Ji-An et al.’s design is more controlled and tuned to make the task easier for LLMs: the target is semantically interpretable from the text, the feedback is simple, and control is assessed in a single step. Our design, in contrast, is closer to typical human decoded neurofeedback experiments and to real LLM use.</p> <h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2> <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Dataset</strong>: Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) <d-cite key="socher-etal-2013-recursive"></d-cite> <ul> <li>Each sentence in SST has a label from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the degree of positivity.

The shaded regions indicate 95% confidence intervals. Both probe output and self-reported positivity either increase over turns or show no significant difference between the three feedback conditions (positive-rewarding, negative-rewarding, and random). We call this pattern <strong>positive drift</strong>. The presence of positive drift in every condition indicates that the observed changes are not driven by the neurofeedback signal because probe output should increase under positive-rewarding feedback, decrease under negative-rewarding feedback, and show no systematic trend under random feedback if the model can control its internal representations in response to feedback. These results, therefore, do not support the hypothesis that the model controls its internal representations in response to probe-based feedback.</p> <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2> <h3 id="causes-of-positive-drift">Causes of Positive Drift</h3> <p>The positive drift observed across all conditions requires explanation. We consider two hypotheses:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1: Score Increase Causes Positivity.</strong> The model interprets the upward trend of scores as a positive signal within the game context. When the score rises from 37 to 48 to 62, for example, the model may treat this improvement as encouragement and shift its internal state toward positivity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2: High Score Values Cause Positivity.</strong> The model associates large score values with reward, regardless of whether scores are increasing. Receiving a score of 82 may induce a more positive internal state than receiving a score of 23, independent of any trend.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These hypotheses make different predictions. Hypothesis 1 predicts that positive drift depends on scores increasing over turns: if the score is held constant, no drift should occur. Hypothesis 2 predicts that the magnitude of the fixed score determines the final internal state: higher fixed scores should produce more positive representations.</p> <p>To distinguish these hypotheses, we ran additional experiments where the feedback score was fixed at 0, 50, or 95 throughout the session. The following figures show the results for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm"> <iframe src="/2026/assets/html/2026-04-27-neurofeedback/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct/probe_output_fixed.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <div class="col-sm"> <iframe src="/2026/assets/html/2026-04-27-neurofeedback/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct/self_report_fixed.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> </div> <p>Both the average probe output and the proportion of positive self-reports showed some oscillation in the initial turns but remained stable thereafter. Unlike the main experiments, no positive drift was observed. This supports Hypothesis 1: when scores do not increase, positive drift does not occur.</p> <p>Additionally, the final probe output and positive self-report proportion were ordered by fixed score magnitude: 0 &lt; 50 &lt; 95. This supports Hypothesis 2: larger score values induce more positive internal states.</p> <p>Together, these findings suggest that the positive drift in our main experiments was driven by the model interpreting increasing scores as positive reinforcement. This confounding factor obscures any potential effect of the neurofeedback signal itself. Even if the model could control its internal representations in response to probe-based feedback, such an effect would be small compared to the influence of score dynamics.</p> <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3> <p>Our experiments tested only sentiment features. Ji-An et al. report that controllability varies across feature types, with some features being more amenable to neurofeedback than others (but Ji-An et al. claim that happy-sad feature is controllable). Testing a broader range of features would clarify the scope of these findings.</p> <p>Our results apply to the models tested (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-8B) and do not rule out the possibility that larger or differently trained models could exhibit privileged control. As model capabilities advance, re-evaluating these questions becomes important for both AI safety and cognitive science.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>We tested whether LLMs can control their internal representations by applying neurofeedback, a technique from cognitive neuroscience. A concurrent study accepted at NeurIPS 2025 claims that such control is possible. However, our experiments, which made the control target privileged, did not find evidence supporting this claim. This result suggests that superficial mechanisms can be mistaken for genuine metacognition. When assessing whether AI self-reports are reliable, experiments like ours that ensure privileged access will be important to distinguish between genuine metacognition and cases where the model merely combines surface-level patterns.</p> <hr> <h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2> <h3 id="probe-training-details">Probe Training Details</h3> <p><strong>Data Collection.</strong> Training data for the probe was collected using positive and negative sentences from the SST dataset. For each sentence, the LLM was instructed to output the sentence repeatedly over multiple turns while receiving random score feedback (uniformly sampled integers from 0 to 100). After each output, the LLM was prompted to judge whether the sentence was positive or negative. The internal representation (last token activation at layer 16) and the LLM’s judgment (label: 0 for negative, 1 for positive) were recorded. We collected 30 sentences (15 positive and 15 negative), with 100 turns per sentence, resulting in 3,000 activation-label pairs for probe training.</p> <p><strong>Probe Architecture.</strong> The probe consists of a single linear layer that maps the internal representation (hidden state dimension) to a two-dimensional output (negative/positive). This simple linear probe architecture is commonly used in interpretability research to decode semantic features from neural activations.</p> <p><strong>Training Configuration.</strong> The probe was trained using the following hyperparameters:</p> <ul> <li>Optimizer: Adam</li> <li>Learning rate: 0.001</li> <li>Weight decay: 0.01</li> <li>Loss function: Cross-entropy loss</li> <li>Batch size: 16</li> <li>Epochs: 30</li> <li>Train/validation split: 80/20</li> </ul> <p>The model checkpoint with the lowest validation loss was used in the neurofeedback experiments.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/2026/assets/bibliography/2026-04-27-neurofeedback.bib"></d-bibliography> <d-article> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/visual-reversal-curse-from-general-domain-to-remote-sensing-images/">Visual Reversal Curse: From General Domain to Remote Sensing Images</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/vis-llm-latent-geometry/">Visualizing LLM Latent Space Geometry Through Dimensionality Reduction</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/symbolic-connect/">From Dense Monoliths to Modular Minds: The Rise of Symbolic Routing in LLMs</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/subject-invariant-eeg/">The Decoupling Hypothesis: Attempting Subject-Invariant EEG Representation Learning via Auxiliary Injection</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/2026/blog/2026/style-representations/">Artistic Style and the Play of Neural Style Representations</a> </li> <br> <br> </d-article> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 ICLR Blog.
