        description: "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet they often struggle with spectral bias,the tendency to prioritize low-frequency patterns while inadequately learning high-frequency details. This limitation stems from the uniform noise scheduling employed during training, which allocates equal denoising capacity across all frequencies regardless of the dataset&#39;s spectral characteristics. We introduce Frequency-Adaptive Noise Shaping (FANS), a principled framework that addresses this fundamental limitation by dynamically shaping noise distributions according to dataset-specific frequency importance. FANS operates on a simple insight - different datasets exhibit distinct spectral signatures, and noise scheduling should reflect these differences. The framework integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion architectures through a simple modification to the noise sampling procedure during training and inference.We validate FANS on synthetic datasets with controlled spectral properties as well as real world data (CIFAR10, CelebA, Texture, MultimodalUniverse) where we demonstrate consistent improvements over vanilla DDPM baselines. Our experiments reveal that FANS particularly excels on high-frequency-rich datasets, producing sharper, more detailed samples while maintaining comparable performance for standard natural image datasets like CIFAR10 and CelebA.",

In this blog post, we investigate recent works that attempt a human-inspired paradigm for processing texts that is converting textual contexts into images and subsequently using visual language models (VLMs) to process them. We start by explaining technical implementations of such conversions and their strengths. We then perform evaluation on long context understanding benchmarks that are more challenging than those used in prior works, with the objective to better analyze how these methods work or fail. Finally, we implement several improvements to existing approaches, including refined conversion techniques and context preprocessing strategies before conversion to images, observing their impacts on task performance to derive insights on future research directions.",

To address this, we establish a fundamental distinction between two notions that we identify as Unlearning and Untraining, aiming to guide the field towards disambiguating technical definitions, to unlock more progress in clarifying goals, designing evaluation metrics for each, and ultimately better algorithms.",

        description: "The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has largely been defined by a dichotomy: the flexible, probabilistic learning of Connectionism versus the rigorous, compositional logic of Symbolism. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fostering a synthesis of these paradigms through a fundamental architectural shift: the move from Dense Monoliths to Modular, Routed Systems. This shift is fractal. At the Macro level, LLMs function as central planners, using symbolic protocols to orchestrate external tools and specialized neural agents. Simultaneously, at the Micro level, the models themselves are evolving into sparse, modular structures (such as Mixture-of-Experts) governed by internal routing mechanisms. In this post, we explore this transition toward Symbolic Routing. We discuss how this paradigm enables us to build societies of neural agents, discover latent modularity within dense networks, thus enabling composable, verifiable, interpretable and continually learnable AI system. And we also discuss how to leverage these structures to synthesize training data and formally verify AI reasoning.",

This post critically evaluates the common PyTorch, Gymnasium, and NumPy RL stack by comparing it to a faster alternative:JAX/Flax for both of model training and environment simulation. A Gridworld example evaluating both training speed and accuracy is utilized to test each of these packages. Additionally, we complement our example by a comprehensive tracking and monitoring of the training process using MLflow along with a thorough hyperparameters optimization via Optuna.

        description: "Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought about a significant change in the field of artificial intelligence, where they have transitioned in scope from being specialized research tools to common resources that drive the next generation of software. With increasing model parameters and training data, LLMs demonstrate new abilities in reasoning, code generation, and solving complex problems that were once considered unattainable. However, scaling these models effectively for long-context applications uniquely poses a challenge. This is primarily due to the inherent limitations of the self-attention mechanism, which has space and time complexity O(N^2). This quadratic bottleneck hinders applications for long documents, high-resolution images, and large codebases, among others. However, what is interesting to observe is that effectively only a few parameters are used when outputting a token, and most calculations are sparse. Hence, Sparsity emerges as an effective solution to this problem. Rather than relying on the N x N attention matrix, one can utilize an approximate or “sparse” version of attention to achieve almost the same results much faster. The backbone of this approach is the idea that tokens do not require the entire context; they only need local context, and thus, most of the computation carried out is wasteful. In this blog, we analyze the types of attention patterns that emerge and how to use them to our advantage for faster and efficient LLMs.",

        description: "This blogpost develops a geometric and probabilistic lens on diffusion priors for inverse problems. We show that a wide range of methods mostly instantiate two operator-splitting paradigms, i.e., posterior-guided sampling and clean-space local-MAP optimization. Through manifold diagrams, Tweedie-based animations, and step-by-step derivations, we explain how these paradigms decouple a pretrained diffusion prior from measurement physics, clarify when they approximate full posterior sampling versus MAP estimation, and distill practical design rules for building robust diffusion-based inverse solvers.",
