        description: "Diffusion models have transformed generative modeling, powering breakthroughs like Stable Diffusion in images and Sora in video. Yet despite their success, diffusion models share a key limitation - spectral bias; they learn broad, low-frequency structure well but struggle to recover fine, high-frequency details. This happens because the standard uniform noise schedule adds the same Gaussian noise to every frequency band, even though real datasets have very different frequency characteristics. When high-frequency components are overwhelmed with noise early in the forward process, the model learns to regenerate them last, and often poorly leading to the blurred textures and softened edges we observe in many diffusion outputs. Frequency-Adaptive Noise Shaping (FANS) offers a potential way to address this limitation. Instead of treating all frequencies equally, FANS dynamically reshapes the noise distribution based on the true frequency importance of the dataset. This simple yet principled modification plugs directly into existing DDPM architectures and improves denoising where it matters most. Across synthetic datasets (with controlled spectral properties) and real-world benchmarks—including CIFAR-10, CelebA, Texture, and MultimodalUniverse—FANS consistently outperforms vanilla DDPMs, with sharper high-frequency details, lower FID, higher PSNR on reconstruction tasks, and marked gains on texture-rich domains (e.g., up to significant relative improvements in perceptual sharpness and detail fidelity). And crucially, it achieves these benefits without sacrificing performance on standard natural-image datasets.",

We start by explaining technical implementations of such conversions and their strengths. We then perform evaluation on long context understanding benchmarks that are more challenging than those used in prior works, with the objective to better analyze how these methods work or fail. Finally, we implement several improvements to existing approaches, including refined conversion techniques and context preprocessing strategies before conversion to images, observing their impacts on task performance to derive insights on future research directions.",

Through thought experiments and concrete probes, the post shows how representational limits, identifiability barriers, and optimization constraints create predictable blind spots in model behavior. Understanding this shadow is essential for building safer systems, designing better benchmarks, and avoiding misplaced confidence in model outputs.

However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fostering a synthesis of these paradigms through a fundamental architectural shift: the move from Dense Monoliths to Modular, Routed Systems. This shift is fractal. At the Macro level, LLMs function as central planners, using symbolic protocols to orchestrate external tools and specialized neural agents. Simultaneously, at the Micro level, the models themselves are evolving into sparse, modular structures (such as Mixture-of-Experts) governed by internal routing mechanisms. In this post, we explore this transition toward Symbolic Routing. We discuss how this paradigm enables us to build societies of neural agents, discover latent modularity within dense networks, thus enabling composable, verifiable, interpretable and continually learnable AI system. And we also discuss how to leverage these structures to synthesize training data and formally verify AI reasoning.",

This is primarily due to the inherent limitations of the self-attention mechanism, which has quadratic time complexity. This quadratic bottleneck hinders applications for long documents, high-resolution images, and large codebases, among others. However, what is interesting to observe is that effectively only a few parameters are used in token computation, and most calculations are sparse. Hence, sparsity emerges as an effective solution to this problem. Rather than relying on the entire attention matrix, one can utilize an approximate or sparse version of attention to achieve almost the same results much faster. The backbone of this approach is the idea that tokens do not require the entire context; they only need local context, and thus, most of the computation carried out is wasteful. In this blog, we analyze the types of attention patterns that emerge and how to use them to our advantage for faster and efficient LLMs.",

        description: "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) optimizes large language models on tasks with objective correctness criteria by directly leveraging deterministic reward signals rather than learned preferences. While theoretically principled, online RLVR remains computationally prohibitive due to tight coupling of generation and optimization, which inflates memory and severely limits training throughput. We prove this gap is architectural, not fundamental. Online RLVR can be reformulated exactly as offline supervised fine-tuning with importance-weighted samples. We introduce Decoupled Generation &amp; Optimization (DGO), a two-phase paradigm that separates generation from optimization, reducing peak memory by ~18-31% and training time by ~75-85% while enabling multi-epoch training. Our framework unifies existing offline methods, exposes systematic theory-practice mismatches, and establishes DGO as the first method where theoretical optimal weights align perfectly with implementation. We show scaling online RLVR is achievable when done right, through principled decoupling and theoretically-grounded design.",

We examine how local edits differ from global ones, why forgetting resembles suppression rather than deletion, and how repeated modifications can change a model’s identity. By framing model editing as a philosophical and structural question rather than a purely technical procedure, this piece highlights the need to evaluate edits not only for local correctness but also for their impact on coherence, ontology, and long-term behavior.",

Then, we model the LLM&#39;s preferences to make different choices as a priority graph, where instructions and values are nodes, and the edges represent context-specific priorities determined by the model&#39;s output distribution. This graph reveals that a unified stable LLM alignment is very challenging, because the graph is not static in different contexts. Besides, it also reveals a potential vulnerability: priority hacking, where adversaries can craft deceptive contexts to manipulate the graph and bypass safety alignments. To counter this, we propose a runtime verification mechanism, enabling LLMs to query external sources to ground their context and resist manipulation. While this approach enhances robustness, we also acknowledge that many ethical and value dilemmas are philosophically irreducible, posing an open challenge for the future of AI alignment.",

New model-based methods offer more principled insight&amp;#58 Sparse Autoencoders extract sparse, interpretable features from dense activations; Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization uncovers how neuron groups themselves encode concepts; Cross-Layer Transcoders track how these representations evolve across depth; and Weight-Sparse Transformers encourage inherently modular computation through architectural sparsity. Together, these approaches provide complementary pathways for opening the black box and understanding the circuits that underpin transformer behavior.",

        description: "Park et al., 2025 demonstrate that large language models can learn to trace random walks on graphs presented in context, and observe that token representations reorganize to reflect the underlying graph structure. This has been interpreted as evidence that models &#39;flexibly manipulate their representations&#39; to reflect in-context semantics, and that this reorganization enables task performance. We offer a simpler mechanistic explanation. We first observe that task performance can be fully explained by induction circuits (Olsson et al., 2022), and show that ablating the attention heads that comprise these circuits substantially degrades performance. As for the geometric structure, we propose that it could result from previous token heads effectively mixing the representations of graph neighbors together. We show that a single round of such &#39;neighbor mixing&#39; on random embeddings recreates the observed graph correspondence in PCA visualizations. These results suggest that apparent &#39;representation reorganization&#39; may be a byproduct of the model&#39;s induction circuits, rather than a critical strategy useful for in-context learning.",

        description: "As coding agents have seen rapid capability and adoption gains, users are applying them to general tasks beyond software engineering. In this post, we investigate whether coding agents can successfully generalize to end-to-end business process automation. We identify gaps in current evaluations, and conduct a case study to evaluate a coding agent on practical business tasks in an open-core Enterprise Resource Planning system. We find that the agent reliably completes simple tasks but exhibits characteristic failures on complex tasks, suggesting that bridging domain logic and code execution is a key bottleneck to generalizability.",

        description: "As AI systems begin drafting full research reports, our long-standing evaluation mindset is hitting its limits. We are used to benchmarking models on massive data sets with well-defined, comparable metrics. But modern AI-generated science is now judged on only a small number of long, open-ended research outputs, making traditional notions of generalization hard to verify. In the absence of standard evaluation frameworks, researchers find themselves creating case-specific evaluation criteria. This blog is a wake-up call, a look at how quickly LLM-based scientific agents are outgrowing our inherited evaluation paradigms, and why we must rethink our long-held assumptions to build rigorous and standardized ways of assessing this new form of AI-driven scientific work.",

        description: "For most of the history of information retrieval (IR), search results were designed for human consumers who could scan, filter, and discard irrelevant information on their own. This shaped retrieval systems to optimize for finding and ranking more relevant documents, but not keeping results clean and minimal, as the human was the final filter. However, LLMs have changed that by lacking this filtering ability. To address this, we introduce Bits-over-Random (BoR), a chance-corrected measure of retrieval selectivity that reveals when high success rates mask random-level performance.",

Most teams turn to an LLM-as-a-judge: an approach that grasps the nuances of natural language where classical metrics fall short. But these judge models have their own “will”: sometimes they follow instructions precisely, sometimes they don&#39;t. To address this inconsistency, the judge prompt is calibrated to align with known, trusted cases. The problem? Manual calibration is time-consuming and error-prone. In this blog post, we explore auto-calibration techniques inspired by recent prompt-optimization research. We tackle context collapse by iteratively processing data in batches, similarly to a machine learning training pipeline. Along the way, we share some surprising findings about what works and what doesn&#39;t—including cases where simpler approaches outperform more sophisticated ones.",
