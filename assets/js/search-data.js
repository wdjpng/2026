This post critically evaluates the common PyTorch, Gymnasium, and NumPy RL stack by comparing it to a faster alternative:JAX/Flax for both of model training and environment simulation. A Gridworld example evaluating both training speed and accuracy is utilized to test each of these packages. Additionally, we complement our example by a comprehensive tracking and monitoring of the training process using MLflow along with a thorough hyperparameters optimization via Optuna.

These methods typically assume that simulators faithfully represent the true data-generating process, an assumption that is often violated in practice. Resulting discrepancies can make observed data effectively out-of-distribution relative to the simulations, leading to biased posterior distributions and misleading uncertainty quantification. This post reviews recent work on model misspecification in neural SBI, covering formal definitions, methods for detection and mitigation, and their underlying assumptions. It also discusses practical implications for SBI workflows and outlines open challenges for developing robust SBI methods that remain reliable in realistic, imperfectly specified applications.",

But intelligence is a moving target—hard to define and even harder to link to what we actually need models to do, like answer questions, summarize text, or write code. Optimizing for these abstract tests can pull evaluation away from real-world usefulness. We argue for a shift from chasing intelligence to measuring generality. This reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks.",

        description: "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more powerful and autonomous, they increasingly face conflicts and dilemmas in many scenarios. We first summarize and taxonomize these diverse conflicts. Then, we model the LLM&#39;s preferences to make different choices as a priority graph, where instructions and values are nodes, and the edges represent context-specific priorities determined by the model&#39;s output distribution. This graph reveals that a unified stable LLM alignment is very challenging, because the graph is not static in different contexts. Besides, it also reveals a potential vulnerability: priority hacking, where adversaries can craft deceptive contexts to manipulate the graph and bypass safety alignments. To counter this, we propose a runtime verification mechanism, enabling LLMs to query external sources to ground their context and resist manipulation. While this approach enhances robustness, we also acknowledge that many ethical and value dilemmas are philosophically irreducible, posing an open challenge for the future of AI alignment.",

We show that JustRL, a simple recipe with fixed hyperparameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance on two different 1.5B base models (54.5% and 64.3% across 9 math benchmarks) while using 2× less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training remains stable over thousands of steps without intervention. This suggests the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline.",
