        description: "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet they often struggle with spectral bias,the tendency to prioritize low-frequency patterns while inadequately learning high-frequency details. This limitation stems from the uniform noise scheduling employed during training, which allocates equal denoising capacity across all frequencies regardless of the dataset&#39;s spectral characteristics. We introduce Frequency-Adaptive Noise Shaping (FANS), a principled framework that addresses this fundamental limitation by dynamically shaping noise distributions according to dataset-specific frequency importance. FANS operates on a simple insight - different datasets exhibit distinct spectral signatures, and noise scheduling should reflect these differences. The framework integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion architectures through a simple modification to the noise sampling procedure during training and inference.We validate FANS on synthetic datasets with controlled spectral properties as well as real world data (CIFAR10, CelebA, Texture, MultimodalUniverse) where we demonstrate consistent improvements over vanilla DDPM baselines. Our experiments reveal that FANS particularly excels on high-frequency-rich datasets, producing sharper, more detailed samples while maintaining comparable performance for standard natural image datasets like CIFAR10 and CelebA.",

In this blog post, we investigate recent works that attempt a human-inspired paradigm for processing texts that is converting textual contexts into images and subsequently using visual language models (VLMs) to process them. We start by explaining technical implementations of such conversions and their strengths. We then perform evaluation on long context understanding benchmarks that are more challenging than those used in prior works, with the objective to better analyze how these methods work or fail. Finally, we implement several improvements to existing approaches, including refined conversion techniques and context preprocessing strategies before conversion to images, observing their impacts on task performance to derive insights on future research directions.",

To address this, we establish a fundamental distinction between two notions that we identify as Unlearning and Untraining, aiming to guide the field towards disambiguating technical definitions, to unlock more progress in clarifying goals, designing evaluation metrics for each, and ultimately better algorithms.",

        description: "The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has largely been defined by a dichotomy: the flexible, probabilistic learning of Connectionism versus the rigorous, compositional logic of Symbolism. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fostering a synthesis of these paradigms through a fundamental architectural shift: the move from Dense Monoliths to Modular, Routed Systems. This shift is fractal. At the Macro level, LLMs function as central planners, using symbolic protocols to orchestrate external tools and specialized neural agents. Simultaneously, at the Micro level, the models themselves are evolving into sparse, modular structures (such as Mixture-of-Experts) governed by internal routing mechanisms. In this post, we explore this transition toward Symbolic Routing. We discuss how this paradigm enables us to build societies of neural agents, discover latent modularity within dense networks, thus enabling composable, verifiable, interpretable and continually learnable AI system. And we also discuss how to leverage these structures to synthesize training data and formally verify AI reasoning.",

        description: "Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought about a significant change in the field of artificial intelligence, where they have transitioned in scope from being specialized research tools to common resources that drive the next generation of software. With increasing model parameters and training data, LLMs demonstrate new abilities in reasoning, code generation, and solving complex problems that were once considered unattainable. However, scaling these models effectively for long-context applications uniquely poses a challenge. This is primarily due to the inherent limitations of the self-attention mechanism, which has time complexity O(N^2). This quadratic bottleneck hinders applications for long documents, high-resolution images, and large codebases, among others. However, what is interesting to observe is that effectively only a few parameters are used in token computation, and most calculations are sparse. Hence, Sparsity emerges as an effective solution to this problem. Rather than relying on the N x N attention matrix, one can utilize an approximate or “sparse” version of attention to achieve almost the same results much faster. The backbone of this approach is the idea that tokens do not require the entire context; they only need local context, and thus, most of the computation carried out is wasteful. In this blog, we analyze the types of attention patterns that emerge and how to use them to our advantage for faster and efficient LLMs.",

        description: "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) optimizes large language models on tasks with objective correctness criteria by directly leveraging deterministic reward signals rather than learned preferences. While theoretically principled, online RLVR remains computationally prohibitive due to tight coupling of generation and optimization, which inflates memory and severely limits training throughput. We prove this gap is architectural, not fundamental. Online RLVR can be reformulated exactly as offline supervised fine-tuning with importance-weighted samples. We introduce Decoupled Generation &amp; Optimization (DGO), a two-phase paradigm that separates generation from optimization, reducing peak memory by ~18-31% and training time by ~75-85% while enabling multi-epoch training. Our framework unifies existing offline methods, exposes systematic theory-practice mismatches, and establishes DGO as the first method where theoretical optimal weights align perfectly with implementation. We show scaling online RLVR is achievable when done right, through principled decoupling and theoretically-grounded design.",

This prompts consideration of recurrent structures, where models reuse parameters across sequential time, depth, or training progression to achieve improved performance and reduced training cost. We draw connections in the landscape of parameter reuse, from growing models via stacking to recurrent looping, and postulate that these architectural priors act as a form of Latent Chain of Thought (LCoT), allowing models to reason in a continuous state space. By shifting towards deeper and dynamic computation, grown and recurrent architectures offer a path toward improved reasoning in compact networks, ascending beyond scaling laws of standard architectures.",

        description: "I present diffusion models as part of a family of machine learning techniques that withhold information from a model’s input and train it to guess the withheld information. I argue that diffusion&#39;s destroying approach to withholding is more flexible than typical hand-crafted information withholding techniques, providing a rich training playground that could be advantageous in some settings, notably data-scarce ones. I then address subtle issues that may arise when porting reinforcement learning techniques to the diffusion context, and wonder how such exploration problems could be addressed in more diffusion-native ways. I do not have definitive answers, but I do point my fingers in directions I deem interesting. A tutorial follows this thesis, expanding on the destroy-then-generate perspective. A novel kind of probabilistic graphical models is introduced to facilitate the totorial&#39;s exposition.",

        description: "For most of the history of information retrieval (IR), search results were designed for human consumers who could scan, filter, and discard irrelevant information on their own. This shaped retrieval systems to optimize for finding and ranking more relevant documents, but not keeping results clean and minimal, as the human was the final filter. However, LLMs have changed that by lacking this filtering ability. To address this, we introduce Bits-over-Random (BoR), a chance-corrected measure of retrieval selectivity that reveals when high success rates mask random-level performance.",

        description: "How do you evaluate Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems in production at scale? Most teams turn to an LLM-as-a-judge: an approach that grasps the nuances of natural language where classical metrics fall short. But these judge models have their own “will”: sometimes they follow instructions precisely, sometimes they don&#39;t. To address this inconsistency, the judge prompt is calibrated to align with known, trusted cases. The problem? Manual calibration is time-consuming and error-prone. In this blog post, we explore auto-calibration techniques inspired by recent prompt-optimization research. We tackle context collapse by iteratively processing data in batches, similarly to a machine learning training pipeline. Along the way, we share some surprising findings about what works and what doesn&#39;t—including cases where simpler approaches outperform more sophisticated ones.",
