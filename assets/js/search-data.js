        description: "The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has largely been defined by a dichotomy: the flexible, probabilistic learning of Connectionism versus the rigorous, compositional logic of Symbolism. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fostering a synthesis of these paradigms through a fundamental architectural shift: the move from Dense Monoliths to Modular, Routed Systems. This shift is fractal. At the Macro level, LLMs function as central planners, using symbolic protocols to orchestrate external tools and specialized neural agents. Simultaneously, at the Micro level, the models themselves are evolving into sparse, modular structures (such as Mixture-of-Experts) governed by internal routing mechanisms. In this post, we explore this transition toward Symbolic Routing. We discuss how this paradigm enables us to build societies of neural agents, discover latent modularity within dense networks, thus enabling composable, verifiable, interpretable and continually learnable AI system. And we also discuss how to leverage these structures to synthesize training data and formally verify AI reasoning.",

While theoretically principled, online RLVR remains computationally prohibitive due to tight coupling of generation and optimization, which inflates memory and severely limits training throughput. We prove this gap is architectural, not fundamental. Online RLVR can be reformulated exactly as offline supervised fine-tuning with importance-weighted samples. We introduce Decoupled Generation &amp; Optimization (DGO), a two-phase paradigm that separates generation from optimization, reducing peak memory by ~18-31% and training time by ~75-85% while enabling multi-epoch training. Our framework unifies existing offline methods, exposes systematic theory-practice mismatches, and establishes DGO as the first method where theoretical optimal weights align perfectly with implementation. We show scaling online RLVR is achievable when done right, through principled decoupling and theoretically-grounded design.",

This prompts consideration of recurrent structures, where models reuse parameters across sequential time, depth, or training progression to achieve improved performance and reduced training cost. We draw connections in the landscape of parameter reuse, from growing models via stacking to recurrent looping, and postulate that these architectural priors act as a form of Latent Chain of Thought (LCoT), allowing models to reason in a continuous state space. By shifting towards deeper and dynamic computation, grown and recurrent architectures offer a path toward improved reasoning in compact networks, ascending beyond scaling laws of standard architectures.",

We propose in-context neurofeedback, a method that uses multi-turn conversation to control internal representations while ensuring privileged access requirements, and provide a methodological framework for future investigations into machine metacognition.",

        description: "Park et al., 2025 demonstrate that large language models can learn to trace random walks on graphs presented in context, and observe that token representations reorganize to reflect the underlying graph structure. This has been interpreted as evidence that models &#39;flexibly manipulate their representations&#39; to reflect in-context semantics, and that this reorganization enables task performance. We offer a simpler mechanistic explanation. We first observe that task performance can be fully explained by induction circuits (Olsson et al., 2022), and show that ablating the attention heads that comprise these circuits substantially degrades performance. As for the geometric structure, we propose that it could result from previous token heads effectively mixing the representations of graph neighbors together. We show that a single round of such &#39;neighbor mixing&#39; on random embeddings recreates the observed graph correspondence in PCA visualizations. These results suggest that apparent &#39;representation reorganization&#39; may be a byproduct of the model&#39;s induction circuits, rather than a critical strategy useful for in-context learning.",

        description: "How do you evaluate Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems in production at scale? Most teams turn to an LLM-as-a-judge: an approach that grasps the nuances of natural language where classical metrics fall short. But these judge models have their own “will”: sometimes they follow instructions precisely, sometimes they don&#39;t. To address this inconsistency, the judge prompt is calibrated to align with known, trusted cases. The problem? Manual calibration is time-consuming and error-prone. In this blog post, we explore auto-calibration techniques inspired by recent prompt-optimization research. We tackle context collapse by iteratively processing data in batches, similarly to a machine learning training pipeline. Along the way, we share some surprising findings about what works and what doesn&#39;t—including cases where simpler approaches outperform more sophisticated ones.",

        description: "Adversarial inputs exhibit systematically lower Jacobian condition numbers at early transformer layers—the opposite of our initial hypothesis that attacks exploit unstable regions. This paradox reveals that adversarial attacks succeed by finding well-conditioned directions that cross decision boundaries.",
