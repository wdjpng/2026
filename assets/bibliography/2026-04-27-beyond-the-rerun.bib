We argue that even though Jupyter helps users perform complex, technical work, Jupyter itself solves problems that are fundamentally human in nature. Namely, Jupyter helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1) interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the impact of these dimensions on a community of practice in earth and climate science.},
