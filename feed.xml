It responds politely in Japanese — but behind the scenes, it’s reasoning in English/Chinese. Variables, steps, and mathematical lemmas often silently switch languages during reasoning. This behavior, where models default to English for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, is more than a curiosity. It breaks instruction-following, confuses human overseers, and undermines the purpose of multilingual evaluation.</p> <p>The goal is clear: we want models to reason about a question in the language they are asked — not just to answer in that language. But this turns out to be harder than it sounds. Forcing models to reason in non-English languages usually leads to a drop in accuracy. Previous work shows that instructing models to reason only in the prompt language via prompting or steering improves coherence and grading alignment <d-cite key="zhong2025language"></d-cite>, but often comes at a steep “accuracy tax.” Even a small amount of multilingual fine-tuning helps, but doesn’t eliminate the trade-off <d-cite key="qi-etal-2025-models"></d-cite>. Further, models not only prefer to reason in English — they reason <em>more effectively</em> in English. When researchers force strict in-language reasoning (e.g., in Swahili or Thai), models often lose accuracy compared to when allowed to reason in English. For higher-resource languages like French or German, this trade-off is smaller — models can reason in-language nearly as well as in English. For low-resource languages, strict enforcement harms performance more significantly.</p> <p>Why do models switch to English in the first place? Much of it traces back to training. Most reasoning data are in English. Fine-tuning even strong multilingual models on English CoT data often leads them to adopt English as their “internal language of logic.” Yong et al. (2025) observe a “quote-and-think” behavior <d-cite key="yong2025crosslingual"></d-cite>, where models copy input phrases in the prompt language, but explain everything in English <d-cite key="kim2025one"></d-cite>. The model understands the question in the non-English language — it just prefers to reason in English.</p> <p>Our technical goal is simple: <strong>stop the switching without paying an accuracy tax</strong> — ideally, push the Pareto frontier of <em>(Accuracy, Language-consistency)</em>.<br/> And we want this post to serve as a practical guide with lessons learned along the way.</p> <p>Code, data, and checkpoints will be linked in the <strong>camera-ready</strong> version of this post to preserve anonymity during review.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="what-we-try-method-in-two-steps">What we try (Method in two steps)</h2> <p>🔧 <strong>Base model.</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</code>, a large reasoning model distilled from R1 through supervised fine-tuning on its reasoning traces, exhibiting an English/Chinese-dominant prior.</p> <p><strong>Step 1 — Small SFT to teach in-language reasoning.</strong><br/> We fine-tune on <strong>817 curated multilingual reasoning chains</strong> (from LiMO <d-cite key="ye2025limo"></d-cite>). This supervision data contains high-quality reasoning data matching R1 long-form reasoning <em>style</em>. No Reinforcement Learning (RL) here — just teach the policy to keep reasoning in the user’s query language.</p> <p><strong>Step 2 — Math-only GRPO to push accuracy while retaining reasoning language.</strong><br/> We run an RLVR-style GRPO with no KL, higher clip of 0.28 vs −0.2 (DAPO-like <d-cite key="yu2025dapo"></d-cite>), rollout 24, LoRA r = 8, LR = 1e-5, <strong>only on a Math-500 set translated to each language</strong>.<br/> Intuition: let RL optimize hard cases and verification behaviors, while the high clip reduces catastrophic reasoning style collapse back to English.</p> <p>We set the verifiable rewards as <strong>1.0 for accuracy, 0.2 for language consistency of reasoning traces, and 0.2 for answer format</strong> <d-cite key="rastogi2025magistral"></d-cite>.</p> <p>📊 <strong>Evaluation.</strong></p> <p>We tried our approach on three different languages: <strong>Japanese (JA) / French (FR) / Spanish (ES)</strong></p> <p>And tested on multiple datasets: <strong>MMLU College Math (MMLU Math), AIME25, GPQA, MMLU Pro Medicine (MMLU Med)</strong></p> <p>The first two are in-domain: MMLU-Math is similar to the training data in terms of hardness, while AIME25 is harder.<br/> The other two are out-of-domain: GPQA covers hard science questions, and MMLU Pro Medicine is made up of hard questions in the medical domain.</p> <p><strong>Regimes tested:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Base → <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</code> <d-cite key="deepseekai2025deepseekr1distillqwen7b"></d-cite></li> <li>SFT on top of Base</li> <li>GRPO-from-Base</li> <li>GRPO-from-SFT</li> </ul> <p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pass@k(1,5,10)</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n = 32</code> for accuracy</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Language-consistency %</code> (both reasoning traces <strong>and</strong> final answers must be in the requested language; script-aware checks)</li> </ul> <p><strong>How we score language consistency:</strong><br/> We check the entire CoT span and the final boxed answer.<br/> A sample counts as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Following = 1</code> only if both passages are in the requested language (script tokens, numerals, and markers allowed); otherwise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>.<br/> We report the % across the set.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="-key-contributions">🔑 Key contributions</h2> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Small SFT reprograms inner monologue.</strong><br/> With only <strong>817 chains</strong>, language consistency rises near the ceiling in French/Spanish across datasets and substantially in Japanese (Fig. RQ0).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Two-step recipe Pareto-improves.</strong><br/> SFT secures language consistency; <strong>GRPO-SFT recovers/boosts accuracy on tough sets</strong> (AIME/GPQA) without reverting to English (Figs.

Adding math-only GRPO then recovers or improves accuracy on hard sets like AIME and GPQA while mostly preserving SFT’s language consistency discipline — pushing the Accuracy × Following frontier in many language–dataset pairs. The two pain points, Japanese (tokenization/numeric friction) and medicine (reward/style mismatch), are expected from the base prior and training signal, and both have potential straightforward fixes with light domain augmentation. And surprisingly, model merging can be very useful and effective.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Figure 1.a) Performance comparison overall across methods</strong></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1a-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1a-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1a-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1a.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><strong>Figure 1.b) Overall language consistency rate comparison across methods</strong></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1b-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1b-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1b-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1b.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <hr/> <h2 id="rq0--can-small-sft-reprogram-a-reasoning-models-reasoning-tone">RQ0 — Can small SFT reprogram a reasoning model’s “reasoning tone”?</h2> <p>Models often output the final answer in the same language as the user query.

Introduction</h2> <p><span id="sec:introduction"></span></p> <p>Large language models leverage <strong>in-context learning (ICL)</strong> by adapting their predictions at inference time based solely on provided examples, without requiring any gradient updates. Building on this idea, recent work on <strong>tabular foundation models</strong>, such as TabPFN, TabICL, Mitra, and Limix, extends the same paradigm to tabular data <d-cite key="hollmann2022tabpfn,hollmann2025accurate,qu2025tabicl,zhang2025mitra,zhang2025limix"></d-cite>. These models are trained once on synthetic tasks drawn from a prior, allowing them to approximate the posterior predictive distribution</p> \[p(y_{*} \mid x_*, D_{\text{train}})\] <p>in a single forward pass by supplying the training set as context, without any dataset-specific fine-tuning, without fine-tuning on each new dataset <d-cite key="hollmann2022tabpfn,hollmann2025accurate"></d-cite>. This approach is compelling because it contrasts with most deep tabular models—like TabNet, FT-Transformer, NODE, TabM, or retrieval-style models such as TabR and ModernNCA, which typically require dataset-specific training or fine-tuning <d-cite key="arik2021tabnet,gorishniy2021revisiting,popov2019neural,gorishniy2024tabm,gorishniy2023tabr,ye2024modern"></d-cite>. That dependency undermines the ideal of a true “drop-in foundation model.”</p> <p>ICL-based tabular models move closer to this ideal. However, they face a major practical limitation: <strong>context length</strong>. Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length, and current public TabPFN implementations are constrained to around 3,000 samples in the original work to 10,000<d-footnote>At the time of writing, the new TabPFN v2.5 model has just been released, which is supposed to have pushed the context limit further to 50,000.</d-footnote> in later versions <d-cite key="hollmann2022tabpfn,hollmann2025accurate"></d-cite>. Many real-world tabular datasets far exceed these limits.</p> <p>To address this, researchers have experimented with <strong>shrinking the context</strong>, such as by clustering, partitioning, or retrieving only subsets of the data. Examples include random-forest partitioning <d-cite key="hollmann2025accurate"></d-cite>, the Mixture of In-Context Prompters (MICP) <d-cite key="xu2024mixture"></d-cite>, and KNN-style retrieval <d-cite key="thomas2024retrieval"></d-cite>. Others, like TuneTables <d-cite key="feuer2024tunetables"></d-cite>, compress the data into learned representations.</p> <p>While these methods can be effective, they come with two drawbacks:</p> <ul> <li>They often require <strong>dataset-specific tuning</strong> or even retraining, which contradicts the zero-shot, pure ICL philosophy.</li> <li>They don’t use the <strong>entire training set</strong>, which is a core assumption of TabPFN’s Bayesian approximation. Replacing full data with summaries introduces conceptual inaccuracy.</li> </ul> <p>Hence, we ask the following question:</p> <blockquote> <p>Can we fit <strong>all training examples</strong> into the context (no pruning, no KNN) without learnable compression while staying within GPU memory?</p> </blockquote> <p>In this work, we focus specifically on TabPFN, though we believe the conclusions extend to other ICL-based tabular models. Our answer is a resounding <strong>yes</strong>. Indeed, TabPFN’s native implementation already supports this on some devices via <strong>FlashAttention</strong> <d-cite key="dao2022flashattention,dao2023flashattention,shah2024flashattention"></d-cite>. But as we’ll show in this blogpost, there are important caveats:</p> <ul> <li>FlashAttention and similar efficient mechanisms can <strong>fail</strong> when batch or head sizes exceed 65,535.</li> <li>These optimizations are <strong>unsupported</strong> on older or consumer-grade GPUs.</li> </ul> <p>To resolve this, we introduce a <strong>simple patch</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>For efficient attention, we <strong>chunk inputs</strong> along head or batch dimensions to avoid hitting the 65,536 limit.</li> <li>For older GPUs, we implement a <strong>chunked forward pass</strong> in pure PyTorch using the <strong>incremental log-sum-exp trick</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>This patch yields results <strong>identical to standard attention</strong> (up to floating-point associativity), without any approximations, fine-tuning, or pre-filtering.</p> <p>Empirically, we then test TabPFN out-of-the-box scalability by evaluating it on the full <strong>TabArena</strong> benchmark <d-cite key="tabarena"></d-cite>. We specifically analyze TabPFN performance on datasets with <strong>long contexts</strong> (&gt; 10,000). Key findings include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Accuracy improves</strong> with more data, often up to 100,000+ rows (measured in AUC for classification and RMSE for regression).</li> <li>On smaller contexts (&lt;10,000), our chunked version <strong>matches the original</strong>—no hidden degradation.</li> <li>The runtime stays <strong>practical</strong> even on commodity GPUs.</li> </ul> <h2 id="2-methodology">2. Methodology</h2> <p><span id="sec:methodology"></span></p> <p>Let <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(X, y)</code> be the input to the TabPFN model. The typical dimensions of the feature tensor are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[B, L, F]</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> is the number of datasets in the batch, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L</code> is the (padded) sample size, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code> is the number of features. The first thing TabPFN does is group features <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> and embed them, which yields the following shape: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[B, L, G, D]</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code> is the number of feature groups and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> is the embedding size. In the rest of the blog, we assume <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> already has this post-embedding shape.</p> <p>The labels <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> are similarly embedded and then concatenated with the features along the group dimension, producing an input of shape <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[B, L, G + 1, D]</code>. A keen reader might notice that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> effectively have different “logical” lengths: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> includes both train and test samples, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> is only provided for the training split. This is handled by padding the label embeddings for test samples with a dummy embedding. A variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single_eval_pos</code> in the original code holds the index where train and test samples are concatenated, and this logic can be seen in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transformer.py</code> file of the original TabPFN repository.</p> <p>The core of TabPFN is the attention mechanism, whose logic is primarily implemented in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layer.py</code>. TabPFN, like many Transformer-style models, uses attention in two ways: <strong>between samples</strong> and <strong>between features</strong>. The between-sample attention has both self- and cross-attention components: self-attention among training samples and cross-attention from test samples to train samples. Following the TabPFN implementation, we assume attention layers expect input of shape <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[batch, seq_len, input_size]</code>. In the code, the leading dimensions before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(seq_len, input_size)</code> are collapsed via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_rearrange_inputs_to_flat_batch</code>. For between-feature attention this yields an effective batch size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L * B</code>, whereas for between-item (between-sample) attention it yields <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(G + 1) * B</code>.</p> <p>Recall that efficient attention implementations in PyTorch (such as the fused CUDA kernels backing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention</code>) tile work across the <strong>batch</strong> and <strong>head</strong> dimensions. On NVIDIA GPUs of Ampere architecture and below, this effectively limits the product <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B * num_heads</code> to at most <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">65535</code> CUDA blocks; when it reaches <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">65536</code> the kernel can fail with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUDA error: invalid configuration argument</code> (see the corresponding <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/133976">PyTorch GitHub issue</a> for a minimal example where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">65535</code> works but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">65536</code> fails). In TabPFN, large sample sizes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L</code> or a large number of feature groups <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code> can easily push these flattened batch sizes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L * B</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(G + 1) * B</code>) past this limit.</p> <p>A simple practical fix is to loop over the flattened batch dimension in chunks, so that each call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scaled_dot_product_attention</code> stays within the kernel’s limits. This keeps the rest of the model unchanged while avoiding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">invalid configuration</code> errors at large <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>. Conceptually, this is can be done via the following patch to the attention computation.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">outputs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

For those of us working in AI or cognitive neuroscience this question can appear easy at first, but becomes increasingly perplexing the more we think about it. We aren’t short on intuitions: we know that compositionality has something to do with reuse of parts, combinatorial expressive power, systematic generalization, and that natural language is a paradigmatic case, among other things. We seem to be able to glance at some data and say “yes, <em>that</em> is compositional!”, and we largely seem to agree on these judgments. But what is compositionality <em>really</em>, on a mathematical level, and can we quantify it?</p> <p>Formalisms of intuitive concepts have proven incredibly useful in science, and for good reason. Humanity was long aware of things like gravity and drag, but it is only by understanding their deeper mathematical nature that we were able to build things like airplanes. We’re familiar with this phenomenon in AI as well. Since the early days of deep learning, people knew that building the structure of a modality and its symmetries into a model would be helpful, and were making some progress largely through intuition alone — for instance, designing convolutional architectures that are invariant to image translation <d-cite key="fukushima_neocognitron_1980"></d-cite>. However, it was only through the formalizations of Geometric Deep Learning <d-cite key="bronstein_geometric_2021"></d-cite>, which was built on the foundations of abstract algebra, topology, and group theory, that we were able to do this successfully in more general modalities such as graphs and manifolds. In contrast, when it comes to compositionality, we’re largely in the dark. We recognize its computational significance and its potential to address longstanding challenges like out-of-distribution generalization or continual learning, but we fumble around trying to make it emerge in our models without the proper theoretical tools needed to detect it, let alone build it in by design.</p> <p>The purpose of this blog post is to <strong>introduce a formal definition of compositionality</strong>. We don’t promise that it’s perfect — we have no experimental results and none of this has been vetted up to this point by peer review. Nevertheless, we feel like there’s enough here to warrant putting the ideas out in writing for the rest of the community to digest and criticize. As we hope you’ll find, the formal definition that we’re going to propose is both simple and wide-reaching, capturing disparate notions of compositionality within a single equation that applies to any form of data (a neural representation, a dataset, a piece of art or music, a physical object, etc.). We’ll also say quite a bit about <strong>what this definition of compositionality is useful for</strong> in AI, since it has deep implications for how we should build neural architectures and, even more importantly, how we should go about training them through the design of data curricula that <em>maximize compositional structure</em>.</p> <p>This blog post can broadly be divided into three sections. In the <a href="#section-1--compositionality-as-the-emergence-of-novel-shared-structure">first part</a>, we’ll introduce the ideas at a purely <em>intuitive</em> level. In the <a href="#section-2--a-formal-definition-for-quantifying-compositionality">second part</a>, we’ll make these ideas formally precise by expressing them through the mathematics of algorithmic information theory and compression, culminating in a single succinct equation that quantifies compositional structure. In the <a href="#section-3--implications-and-use-cases-for-ai">third and final section</a>, we’ll discuss some practical implications of these ideas for AI, touching on topics such as how to model hierarchical structure and construct data curricula from which knowledge can grow compositionally into the future, in a boundless and open-ended way.</p> <hr/> <h1 id="section-1--compositionality-as-the-emergence-of-novel-shared-structure">Section 1 — Compositionality as the emergence of novel shared structure</h1> <p>Paradigmatic examples of compositional data are easy to think of: a piece of music that recombines nested motifs and themes, an image dataset in which any given scene is made up of a combination of objects, a program that maximizes code reuse by defining a network of functions and classes, and of course natural language which can express an infinite set of ideas using a relatively small set of words and grammatical rules. Clearly, these examples have a lot in common, namely the notion of “parts” or “modules” which interact in complex cascades and at multiple scales to form the “whole” of the object.</p> <p>This sort of multi-scale parts-based structure is what we’re going to try to quantify. To do so, we want to first drill down on the example of <em>computer programs</em> as a backdrop to our discussion that will extend more or less throughout the blog post. There are a few reasons for this. For one, programs are extremely general: any object we can think of can be described through a set of instructions (i.e., a program). Even more important, programs are paradigmatic cases of compositional objects that are familiar to all computer scientists. Once we’ve introduced all of the ideas in the context of computer programs, we’ll abstract them back out so that they apply to <em>any</em> object, be it a piece of music, a painting, an <em>iid</em> dataset, a nonstationary stream of data, a function, etc. — essentially, anything that can be thought of as <em>information</em> expressed in bits.</p> <h2 id="programs-and-libraries">Programs and libraries</h2> <p>We consider some program compositional when it defines and reuses the same structures again and again in novel ways. Crucially, this is a property of the program’s <em>library</em> — the functions, classes, and data structures that it defines in order to optimize code reuse and modularity. By “library” here we want to stress that we do <em>not</em> mean an external package that one might import; we’re considering a self-contained program that makes no reference to external code, and the “library” refers to the reusable structures defined within the program itself — see the example in Figure 1. A compositional program’s library is rich, defining a number of functions and classes that serve as the “parts” which are recomposed. The structures in the library must also be broadly reused across the entire code base rather than only in local regions, otherwise we’re better off talking about multiple independent and non-compositional programs rather than a single compositional one. In addition, the libraries of compositional programs are themselves densely networked: functions and classes build hierarchically and laterally on top of existing ones.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig1-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig1-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig1.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Figure 1: Signatures of compositional programs.</strong> Programs are compositional in virtue of their *libraries:* the classes, functions, and other reusable code that they define. The libraries of compositional programs involve reuse of shared code broadly across the program and have a densely-networked structure. </div> <p>We don’t think any of these high-level signatures of compositionality are particularly controversial. Formalizing these intuitions is more difficult, however: how do we move from <em>qualitative</em> and vague statements like the high-level signatures we outlined above to more <em>quantitative</em> ones that can be precisely expressed in mathematical expressions?</p> <p>One of the key challenges is to specify <em>which</em> library we’re talking about, since any program can be implemented using an infinite number of possible libraries while remaining functionally identical. Is there any way to do this in a non-arbitrary way? For a given program that one might want to implement, is there a notion of the “correct” library one should write, or a library that is intrinsic to the program?</p> <p>It turns out that there is, and it can be arrived at through the goal of <em>compression</em>. Think of what any good programmer would try to do: they would write the reusable code like functions and classes in a way that makes the total length of the program <em>shortest</em>. Other than for reasons of clarity, no programmer would insist on writing a function for some piece of code that is only going to be executed a single time in the program, because doing so wouldn’t help make the program more concise as a whole.</p> <h2 id="growing-and-refactoring-libraries">Growing and refactoring libraries</h2> <p>We now have a way of talking about a program’s <em>intrinsic</em> library as the one that leads to the <em>best compression</em>. To talk about compositionality, we want to quantify the degree to which this library is <em>modular</em> — whether it decomposes into <em>multiple</em> functions and classes that get reused in many places. We also want to quantify the degree to which this modularity is densely <em>networked and hierarchical</em> — whether some elements of the library are used to define <em>other</em> elements inside it, like some functions being recombined to define new ones.</p> <p>If we can see the internals of the library and all of its components in detail, it might be possible to define some graph-theoretic metrics to quantify these things, but they risk being heuristic in nature and difficult to justify as truly general or theoretically-grounded. More problematically, while they may work for the specific case of quantifying compositional structure in programs, we’re primarily using programs as an intuition pump that we’ll later abstract out from. We’re looking for an approach that can just as easily be applied to arbitrary sorts of data like music, art, or datasets used for machine learning. In these other cases, the “library” that we’ll be talking about is less cleanly delineated into distinct modules and parts; clear boundaries might be fuzzy or non-existent, like the boundary between a solid or a liquid phase of matter, and we need our definition of compositionality to be robust here, too.</p> <p>We’re therefore going to take another approach to defining the compositionality of a program that asks how the library <em>grows</em> or <em>changes</em> when we consider increasingly large segments of the program. Basically, if you imagine chunking up a program into some <em>parts</em> (i.e., non-overlapping segments of code), compositional structure exists when the best library for compressing those parts is <em>different</em> from the best library for compressing the whole. Why must this be true? If the library of the whole is different from the libraries of the parts (e.g., it has additional functions), it necessarily means that there were <em>new</em> shared pieces of code among those parts that could be placed in the library as new modules to improve compression. Conversely, if the library of the whole is identical to the libraries of the parts, then the whole program necessarily can’t be more or less compositional than its parts (compositionality is a property of the library, and the libraries are identical); it is just a longer program. It’s only when the library changes, or is refactored, that new compositional structure necessarily emerges. This definition of compositionality in the case of computer programs is summarized below:</p> <blockquote class="notice--info" style="font-size:1.0em !important"> <p><strong>Compositional program</strong> (in English)</p> <p>A program is compositional with respect to some division into parts if the library that best compresses the whole differs from the libraries that best compress the parts.</p> </blockquote> <p>We want to quickly clarify a few things before moving on. First, even when we consider joining parts to make a whole, we’re asking whether or not <em>new</em> compositional structure emerges; even if it does not, the parts themselves might already have compositional structure. This brings us to our second point: this definition of compositionality can be recursively applied to the parts themselves in order to investigate compositionality hierarchically <em>at multiple scales</em>. Finally, this recursive property raises the question of <em>which</em> hierarchical decomposition(s) we should consider, which we’ll have more to say about later in <a href="#section-3--implications-and-use-cases-for-ai">section 3</a>.</p> <h2 id="illustrative-examples">Illustrative examples</h2> <p>For a very abstract definition such as this one, there’s no substitute for concrete examples that illustrate paradigmatic cases of both compositional and non-compositional structure. In some sense this is the entire goal of defining things in the first place — to include all positive cases while leaving out all negative ones using a simple expression — so lets put this one to the test. As before, we’ll make use of programs and libraries to build these concrete examples.</p> <p><strong>Brief notation</strong></p> <p>To avoid things getting to cumbersome, it’s time to introduce a tiny bit of notation. We’ll call a program $x$ and its best library (the one that best compresses it) $m_x$. We’ll denote the parts that we decomposed the program into with subscripts. We’ll just consider splitting the program into two parts for the moment, so that gives us $x_a$ and $x_b$ as well as their corresponding best libraries $m_{x_a}$ and $m_{x_b}$. We also said that we’re quantifying novel compositional structure as the degree to which the library of the whole <em>changes</em> from the libraries of the parts, which implies some sort of distance metric. We’ll call this distance $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b})$ for reasons that will become clearer in <a href="#section-2--a-formal-definition-for-quantifying-compositionality">section 2</a>.</p> <p><strong>Novel shared structure: compositional</strong></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig2-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig2-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig2.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Figure 2: Example of novel shared structure.</strong> Left block shows a program and right blocks show that program split into parts.

This is exactly what is happening in the example of Figure 2, where in order to clearly show how a program is split into parts and which parts of the program share structure we have written them both with and without their libraries. In both $x_a$ and $x_b$, there was no sense in adding a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">norm()</code> function to their respective libraries because there would have been no reuse; the overall programs would have been slightly longer if we had. Both the part libraries $m_{x_a}$ and $m_{x_b}$ are therefore empty. However, when we consider these parts together as a whole in $x$, suddenly it makes sense to write a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">norm()</code> function to shorten the program because it will be used once.</p> <p>The definition we’ve proposed accounts for this: $m_{x_a}$ and $m_{x_b}$ in the example are both empty because there is no code reuse that would benefit from being wrapped in a function, but $m_x$ on the other hand is not empty, making $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b}) &gt; 0$. This is the most minimal case of compositionality that we can construct — one “part” that is reused twice — and the definition correctly identifies it. Of course, the definition would also pick up on more interesting cases in which $m_{x_a}$ and $m_{x_b}$ might not be empty, and $x_a$ and $x_b$ share more interesting structure (e.g., multiple segments of code reuse that result in multiple new functions). In general, what happens in these sorts of cases is that the library of the whole $m_x$ <em>grows</em> with respect to the libraries of the parts $m_{x_a}$ and $m_{x_b}$, and this is always reflected in $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b}) &gt; 0$.</p> <p>It’s important to clarify once again what we mean by “novel shared structure” here. Clearly, the code that is shared between $x_a$ and $x_b$ was already present in each individually. However, when looking at those parts individually, the shared code does not show up in their libraries because it would not help us better compress them individually. It is only when we look at the <em>combination</em> $x = [x_a, x_b]$ that the shared code counts as compositional structure because it now helps us <em>better compress the whole</em>. The shared code itself is not what is novel, then, but rather the fact that this shared code now newly gets added to the library of the whole.</p> <p><strong>No shared structure: not compositional</strong></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig3-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig3-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig3.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Figure 3: Example of no shared structure.</strong> Left block shows a program and right blocks show that program split into parts.

This happens when $x_a$ and $x_b$ are unrelated to each other, such as in the example of Figure 3 where the two parts of a program serve entirely different functional purposes — in other words, they are <em>algorithmically independent</em>. Despite $m_x$ being larger and having more functions than either $m_{x_a}$ or $m_{x_b}$, it does not make sense to talk about $x$ as being more compositional than its parts $x_a$ and $x_b$ because those functions do not interact in any way. Instead, it makes more sense to talk about $x$ as two separate compositional parts that join together but do not compositionally interact with each other, almost like two separate subprograms that have nothing to do with each other.</p> <p>Our definition accounts for this case because the work involved in constructing $m_x$ from $m_{x_a}$ and $m_{x_b}$, which is quantified in $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b})$, is trivially small: the two libraries just need to be concatenated.</p> <p><strong>Fully shared structure: not compositional</strong></p> <p>Another case lacking compositional structure is when the library for $x$ is identical to the one used for either $x_a$ or $x_b$.

But if the library for $x$ is identical to that of either $x_a$ or $x_b$, there is no reason to think of $x$ as being <em>more</em> compositional than its parts. This is the case when $x$ is nothing more than a longer program than $x_a$ or $x_b$ that is in fact reusing the same structures as them throughout.</p> <p>Once again, our definition easily accounts for this case: $m_x$ is identical to one of $m_{x_a}$ or $m_{x_b}$, so it is trivially compressible from them.</p> <blockquote class="notice--primary" style="font-size:0.9em !important"> <p><strong>Box: Compositional generalization</strong></p> <p>We want to give another quick example along these same lines, but this time in the realm of computer vision, since it has important connections to machine learning and generalization. While we’ve just spoken about programs up to this point, this brief digression will foreshadow how we’ll soon generalize the ideas up to this point to arbitrary kinds of data. Imagine that $x_a$ is a dataset of (concatenated) scene images and that $x_b$ is one additional image (nothing says the two objects have to be the same size). For the moment, we can think of the “libraries” in this case as “models” or collections of concepts (objects, possible relations between objects, etc.), although we’ll make this much more precise in <a href="#section-2--a-formal-definition-for-quantifying-compositionality">section 2</a>.</p> <p>If $m_x = m_{x_a}$, it means that the new image $x_b$ consists entirely of known concepts, such that there is no additional structure it could provide.

In this case, the best model of data $x_a$ is <em>also</em> the best explanation of $x = [x_a, x_b]$. This provides very general conditions under which we can meaningfully talk about <em>compositional generalization</em> and when it is even possible: a model can only compositionally generalize to new data, without undergoing additional learning, if that new data provides no additional compositional structure that would serve to change the model.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Building on top of existing structure: compositional</strong></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig4-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig4-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig4.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Figure 4: Example of building on top of existing structure.</strong> Left block shows a program and right blocks show that program split into parts. To more clearly show shared code and how a program is split into parts, each program is written both with and without its library (bottom and top of a block, respectively). </div> <p>Lets now consider a more interesting example that will showcase the reach of the definition we’ve provided. A powerful benefit of compositionality is that it can allow us to describe some concepts as simple functions of others, whereas describing the concept from scratch might be pretty expensive. For instance, defining the concept of a “throne” without prior knowledge of concepts such as “chair” and “royalty” can be quite messy.</p> <p>What does this look like for programs and libraries? Consider the example in Figure 4, where in the first part of a program $x_a$ we were doing a lot of linear algebra, and as such our library $m_{x_a}$ needed to define a function for matrix multiplication <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">def matmul(a, b): ...</code>. Now, lets say that for the second part of our program $x_b$ we were doing some geometry that benefited from a vector norm function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">def norm(v): sqrt(sum([val ** 2 for val in v]))</code>. What will the optimal library $m_x$ look like when we consider $x_a$ and $x_b$ jointly? Crucially, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">norm</code> function <em>will change</em> in the new library because of novel shared structure between $x_a$ and $x_b$. In particular, $m_x$ will now define the function as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">def norm(a): sqrt(matmul(a, a))</code> because this is shorter once we already have code for implementing matrix multiplication. We have compositionality here because we get to re-express some concept (the norm of a vector) in terms of other concepts (matrix multiplication and square root). Crucially, in this case, it’s not that the library $m_x$ grew with respect to $[m_{x_a}, m_{x_b}]$, but that it was <em>refactored</em> from them because novel shared structure resulted in a better strategy for compression.</p> <p>How does our definition account for this notion of compositionality? Effectively, we’ll have that $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_a}) &gt; 0$ because the implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">norm</code> function in $m_x$ is a new component of the library — it was implemented differently in $m_{x_b}$, and has to be rewritten. Granted, in this example $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_a})$ will be quite small since the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">norm</code> function is very easy to write given the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matmul</code> function in $m_{x_a}$, but the point we’re making is more general. Whenever novel structures or concepts can be succinctly described in terms of others, our definition correctly identifies this as a case of compositionality.</p> <h2 id="generalization-to-any-object-good-libraries-as-occams-razor-models">Generalization to any object: good libraries as Occam’s razor models</h2> <p>We hope that the above discussion of programs and libraries has been helpful for building intuition about compositionality, but ultimately we need to generalize outside of this particular case. For this, we’ll be replacing the notion of a program with that of <em>any</em> arbitrary data that can be expressed in bits. This encompasses things like music, images, <em>iid</em> datasets, non-stationary data streams, neural representations, functions, natural language utterances, computer programs — basically, anything that is scientifically interesting. The bigger question is: what should we replace the notion of the program’s <em>library</em> with? The analogous concept turns out to be a <em>model</em> of the data.</p> <p>A model, like a program’s library, captures <em>structure</em> in the data: patterns of information that repeat in some shape or form, either in a quite literal sense (like a repeating subsequence of bits) or in more abstract ways (like a rule or template with adjustable parameters). Just like in a computer program, the patterns of information captured by a model can be interdependent and hierarchically-defined, like in a deep neural network where representations are built upon each other.</p> <p>What all this means is that a model, like a program’s library, can <em>compress</em> the data in ways we’ll make more precise in <a href="#section-2--a-formal-definition-for-quantifying-compositionality">section 2</a>. A model can be thought of as a shorter explanation of a more complex object. If we give you a pattern of bits like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01001100011100001111...</code> and ask you what’s going on, you’ll probably say something like “alternate groups of 0’s and 1’s and increase the group size by one each time” — that’s a model of the data (in this case a generative one) that can help us compress the string with far fewer bits because the model is simple and easy to encode. Even if the model isn’t perfect and has some degree of error (e.g., imagine corrupting the above string with a bit of noise), it can still help with compression because encoding the model along with a few error-correcting bits can be easier than encoding the entire string verbatim.</p> <blockquote class="notice--primary" style="font-size:0.9em !important"> <p><strong>Box: Models of individual objects rather than datasets</strong></p> <p>We want to quickly head off a potential confusion for the machine learning audience. We’re accustomed to modeling <em>datasets</em> (often <em>iid</em> ones), and so the idea of modeling an individual object or a nonstationary stream of data might seem strange. But rest assured that there is nothing wrong with modeling individual objects, and indeed it is not entirely abnormal to see this done in practice. For instance, Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) <d-cite key="stanley_compositional_2007"></d-cite>, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) <d-cite key="mildenhall_nerf_2021"></d-cite>, and various compressors <d-cite key="Balle_2025_CVPR"></d-cite><d-cite key="liao2025arcagiwithoutpretraining"></d-cite> all aim to model an individual objet like an image or a scene. Granted, the ordinary paradigm of sampling datapoints from the training set and minimizing the loss through gradient methods sometimes has to be adapted in such cases, but none of this is essential to modeling anyway.</p> </blockquote> <p>What model should we consider, though, given that we could select among an infinite number of models for any given data? Earlier we considered the library that <em>best compresses</em> a program, and we can take the same approach here. Many will have heard of the principle of Occam’s razor, where we say that the simplest explanation of some data is the best. In machine learning we follow this principle too, whether we realize it or not, when we search for models that achieve low training error (i.e., models that explain the data) but still generalize to the test set (i.e., models that aren’t more complex than they need to be, which would result in overfitting). The Occam’s razor model is an ideal. It is the <em>simplest</em> model that helps us <em>best compress</em> some data, and it is a non-arbitrary way to talk about some data’s “intrinsic” or “true” model in the same way that the most compact implementation of a program gave us a meaningful notion of its intrinsic library.</p> <p>We’re now ready to state our definition for novel compositional structure in the general case. Instead of being a program, $x$ now represents <em>any</em> data that can be expressed in information — in bits. Instead of talking about the library that best compresses a program, $m_x$ is now the Occam’s razor model of the data that allows us to <em>best compress</em> $x$. Since we’ve spoken enough about compression up to this point, we’re also ready to clarify what $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b})$ means: it is the cost of trying to compress the model of the whole given the models of the parts — a quantity that we’ll later formalize using Kolmogorov complexity. Below is the succinct definition, in English:</p> <blockquote class="notice--info" style="font-size:1.0em !important"> <p><strong>Compositionality</strong> (in English)</p> <p>An object is compositional with respect to some division into parts if the model that best compresses the whole isn’t easily derived from the models that best compress the parts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Notice that all of the illustrative examples covered earlier for computer programs still straight-forwardly apply in the general case. Let’s take $x$ to be a pair of images, for instance. Novel shared structure (compositional) might involve the two images $x_a$ and $x_b$ sharing an object that appears in neither image individually. A case of no shared structure (uncompositional) might involve two images with entirely different semantic and structural content, like an image of cells under a microscope and an image of the Rocky Mountains (although the example isn’t perfect, as there is still shared low-level structure). A case of fully shared structure (uncompositional) might be two different images of cells under a microscope. Finally, we already gave an example of structures building on top of others earlier: an image of a throne on its own might involve a complex model, but when joined together with images whose models include the notions of a chair and of royalty, the right way to model a throne now becomes to define it in terms of those pre-existing concepts. Analogous examples can easily be constructed for other kinds of data as well, reflecting the generality of this definition of compositionality.</p> <hr/> <h1 id="section-2--a-formal-definition-for-quantifying-compositionality">Section 2 — A formal definition for quantifying compositionality</h1> <p>In this section, we’ll be formalizing all of the things we’ve said up to this point and making our definition of compositional structure mathematically precise. In particular, we’ll be clarifying the notion of an “Occam’s razor model” $m_x$ of data $x$, as well as the distance metric $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b})$ that we’ve been using to quantify novel compositional structure. Many might already have a very solid intuitive understanding of our definition at this point without the need for more formalisms, and this is no accident: the definition is built on the foundations of <em>algorithmic information theory</em>, which is one of the most intuitive yet powerful branches of mathematics we’ve encountered. Some parts of this section may feel tedious — we’ll be introducing a lot of background and new notation — but if you stick with it, we think that you’ll come away with not only a sharper understanding of compositionality, but also a deeper grasp of far-reaching concepts like information, complexity, structure, modeling, Occam’s razor, and compression.</p> <h2 id="kolmogorov-complexity-and-optimal-compression">Kolmogorov complexity and optimal compression</h2> <p>Kolmogorov complexity <d-cite key="Kolmogorov01011968"></d-cite> — the most important concept in algorithmic information theory — is a formal way to quantify information. Most people are familiar with the Shannon notion of information, so we’ll briefly start there. Shannon information quantifies the amount of information contained in an object $x$ as the length of a coded message that a speaker would need in order to communicate $x$ to a listener. Assuming that $x$ is drawn from some distribution $p$ that is known to both the speaker and the listener, it turns out that the optimal coding scheme that achieves the minimal message length in expectation encodes $x$ using $-\log_2 p(x)$ bits — intuitively, we assign shorter codes to events that are more frequent.</p> <p>Kolmogorov complexity goes one step beyond Shannon information by dropping the assumption that the distribution $p$ is known to both the speaker and listener, and in fact drops the assumption that $x$ is drawn from any distribution at all. In Kolmogorov complexity, we instead only ask one thing: how <em>compressible</em> is $x$? The way that we do this is that we fix a Turing-complete programming language (Python, for instance), and we ask <em>what is the length of the shortest program that I can write which outputs $x$.</em> We denote this quantity $K(x)$.</p> <blockquote class="notice--info" style="font-size:1.0em !important"> <p><strong>Kolmogorov complexity</strong></p> <p>Given some finite string $x$ and a universal Turing machine $U$, the Kolmogorov complexity $K(x)$ is the length $l(r)$ (in bits) of the <strong>shortest</strong> binary program $r$ that prints $x$ and halts:</p> \[K(x) = \min_r \{l(r) : U(r) = x, r \in \{0, 1\}^* \}\] </blockquote> <p>Kolmogorov complexity has many intuitive properties that make it attractive as a measure of information quantity. The smaller and the more structure an object has — regularity, patterns, rules, etc. — the more easily it can be compressed using a short program and the lower its Kolmogorov complexity. For instance, a sequence with repeating patterns or a dataset that spans a low-dimensional subspace can be significantly compressed relative to its original size, and this results in low Kolmogorov complexity. In contrast, a random string devoid of any structure cannot be compressed at all and must in effect be “hard-coded”, making its Kolmogorov complexity equal to its original size in bits.</p> <p>There’s also a conditional notion of Kolmogorov complexity that will be useful, denoted $K(y \mid x)$, which is equal to the length of the shortest program <em>which takes $x$ as input</em> and outputs $y$. Intuitively, this measures the amount of leftover information in $y$ given that we already know $x$. Conditional Kolmogorov complexity $K(y \mid x)$ is of course always less than or equal to $K(y)$ given that we have the option of simply ignoring the input $x$, and it can be significantly smaller than $K(y)$ when $x$ and $y$ share a lot of structure.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig5-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig5-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig5.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Figure 5: Kolmogorov complexity and conditional Kolmogorov complexity.</strong> Kolmogorov complexity is the length of the shortest program that outputs an object, and quantifies information through the lens of compression.

This is easiest to explain through examples. Consider a binary string $x$ that consists exclusively of a repeating sequence of $1$’s: it’s intuitively quite a simple object, and indeed $K(x)$ is quite low because we can print $x$ using a simple for-loop. Now, consider the opposite case of a binary string $y$ that consists of an entirely random sequence of $0$’s and $1$’s: $K(y)$ is maximally large because we have no other choice but to hard-code $y$. In one respect this makes sense — $y$ is incompressible, so in that respect it is indeed “complex”. But there is also a sense in which $y$ is strikingly simple, and in fact just as simple as a constant string like $x$. In particular, neither $y$ nor $x$ can really be said to have complex <em>structure</em>. They are equally boring. Even though $y$ must be described with a very large program, that program itself doesn’t contain much interesting logic outside of simply hard-coding bits, and the distribution from which $y$ might have been drawn would just take a few lines of code to define. In contrast, we can easily imagine a string $z$ that is also difficult to compress with high $K(z)$, but because it contains significant structure (i.e., interesting and sophisticated decompression code) rather than arbitrary randomness.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig6-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig6-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig6-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig6.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Figure 6: Shortcoming of Kolmogorov complexity in measuring structural information.</strong> Kolmogorov complexity does not distinguish between *structural/meaningful* information and *unstructured/random* information. </div> <p>This distinction between <em>structural</em> and <em>random</em> information was important to Kolmogorov himself, who quantified it through a new metric called <em>sophistication</em>. The idea is that we can consider strategies for compressing an object that work in two stages: first we encode some model of the object, and then second we encode the remaining bits of random information unaccounted for by the model. These compression strategies are called “two-part codes”. Let’s consider the model class of computable probability distributions as an example (although this also works with more general model classes). An optimal “two-part code” for an object $x$ that achieves the best possible compression is one that satisfies <d-cite key="grunwald_algorithmic_2008"></d-cite><d-cite key="vitanyi_meaningful_2006"></d-cite>:</p> \[K(x) = K(p_x) - \log_2 p_x(x)\] <p>Here, $p_x$ is the probability distribution that we are using to model $x$ and $K(p_x)$ is the minimum number of bits that it takes to implement this probability distribution in a concrete computer program. Because $p_x$ might not be a perfect model of $x$, we also have to account for error correction bits, which in this case correspond to the ordinary Shannon information $-\log_2 p_x(x)$ (recall that Shannon information assumes access to the probability distribution from which $x$ is drawn, which we have accounted for in $K(p_x)$). There is always <em>at least</em> one model that satisfies this equality. For instance, $p_x$ can trivially put all its probability mass on $x$, in which case it takes $K(p_x) = K(x)$ bits to encode and achieves an error of $-\log_2p_x(x) = 0$ bits. However, in general, there can be <em>many</em> solutions. An interesting model to prefer above the others, though, is the one that is simplest:</p> \[p_x = \mathop{\arg\,\min}\limits_{p_x'} \{ K(p_x') : K(x) = K(p_x') - \log_2 p_x'(x) \}\] <p>Note that in the above equation and for the rest of the blog post, the distribution $p_x$ does <em>not</em> just represent <em>any</em> model of $x$: it represents the <em>simplest one that best compresses it</em>.

Kolmogorov complexity is defined over strings, and we can easily represent something like an <em>iid</em> dataset by, for instance, concatenating individual datapoints together.</p> </blockquote> <p>There’s a nice parallel to machine learning theory here, and in particular the principle of Occam’s razor: we are looking for a simple model with low $K(p_x)$ that nevertheless accurately explains the data with low error $-\log_2 p_x(x)$. The complexity of this model $K(p_x)$ is what Kolmogorov described as the <em>sophistication</em> of the string $x$, and the Occam’s razor model $p_x$ is sometimes called the <em>algorithmic minimal sufficient statistic</em> <d-cite key="grunwald_algorithmic_2008"></d-cite><d-cite key="vitanyi_meaningful_2006"></d-cite>. Sophistication is precisely the quantity that we are looking for in order to distinguish between structured and unstructured information, where $K(x)$ alone was insufficient. If a string is too simple (e.g., a repeating pattern of $1’s$), it can be best compressed by a simple model with low $K(p_x)$. On the other hand, if a string is complex because of random noise rather than structure, $K(p_x)$ is <em>still</em> low because random noise distributions are easy to implement in just a few lines of code. It is only when a string has interesting and complex structure that $K(p_x)$ is high, meaning that the string is best compressed by a complex model.</p> <p>We said earlier that sophistication is defined with respect to some class of models, and that computable probability distributions are just one option. For the rest of the post, to remain more general, we’ll therefore switch to the notation $m_x$ instead of $p_x$ to denote the Occam’s razor model of string $x$.</p> <h2 id="defining-compositionality-through-algorithmic-information-theory">Defining compositionality through algorithmic information theory</h2> <p>We now have all the tools that we need to formally define compositional structure in data, and we can do so essentially just by replacing some of the language in our earlier definition with more precise mathematics. To briefly revisit this intuition, our central argument was that compositionality emerges from <em>novel</em> structure that is <em>shared</em> between an object’s parts. This is what that looks like in math:</p> <blockquote class="notice--info" style="font-size:1.0em !important"> <p><strong>Compositionality</strong></p> <p>An object $x$ is compositional with respect to some division into parts $x = [x_a, x_b]$ if:</p> \[K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b}) &gt; 0\] <p>where the Occam’s razor model of the data $m_x = \mathop{\arg\,\min}\limits_{m_x’} \{ K(m_x’) : K(x) = K(m_x’) + l_{m_x}(x) \}$, and both $m_{x_a}$ and $m_{x_b}$ are defined similarly. The <em>degree</em> of compositional structure is $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b})$.</p> <p><em>Note</em>: $l_{m_x}(x)$ represents the unstructured information in $x$ left unspecified by the model $m_x$. For instance, for the model class of computable probability distributions $l_{m_x}(x) = -\log_2 m_x(x)$.</p> </blockquote> <p>Once again, we need to emphasize that this definition only considers novel compositional structure in $x$ that wasn’t already present in $x_a$ or $x_b$ because it conditions on $m_{x_a}$ and $m_{x_b}$ — for instance, novel shared structure between two images, such as objects that appear in both but not in either individually. This definition does <em>not</em> preclude the possibility that the individual substrings $x_a$ and $x_b$ might themselves have compositional structure, and indeed this is an advantage. As we’ll show in <a href="#section-3--implications-and-use-cases-for-ai">section 3</a>, this helps us easily think about hierarchical compositionality at <em>different scales</em>, since we can simply consider further divisions of the substrings $x_a$ and $x_b$ themselves.</p> <hr/> <h1 id="section-3--implications-and-use-cases-for-ai">Section 3 — Implications and use-cases for AI</h1> <p>We’ve proposed a definition where compositionality is the emergence of novel structure shared between parts. While mathematically rigorous, is it useful? We believe this definition does more than just quantify; it offers a normative framework for understanding why current AI succeeds, how natural intelligence grows, and how we might architect the next generation of open-ended systems.</p> <h2 id="modeling-hierarchical-structure-in-the-real-world">Modeling hierarchical structure in the real world</h2> <p>Real-world data is rarely flat; it is compositional all the way down. Consider an image: simple edges form shapes, shapes form textures, textures form objects, and objects form scenes.</p> <p>Our definition captures this recursion naturally. If we split an image patch $x$ into smaller patches $x_a$ and $x_b$, we find $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b}) &gt; 0$ because the patches share low-level structure (like edges). But when we consider joining two of those larger patches themselves, we can <em>again</em> detect novel compositional structure because the new model will benefit from describing things like simple textures and shapes which reoccur among the two larger patches.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig7-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig7-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig7-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig7.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Figure 7: Hierarchical compositional structure.</strong> In real compositional data, novel shared structure at larger scales is built off of other structure at smaller scales. </div> <p>We can keep playing this game of joining larger segments of data to detect compositionality at increasingly large scales. In the compositionality literature, people typically only consider shared structure between individual datapoints (e.g., by modeling “objects” that get reused among images). We just showed how our definition can account for compositionality at smaller scales, such as <em>within</em> an individual image, but it can also account for compositionality at larger scales that consider <em>sequences</em> of observations in a non-stationary data stream.</p> <p><strong>The alignment with deep learning</strong> This perspective offers a theoretical grounding for the success of deep learning. Neural networks essentially mirror the hierarchical structure of natural data.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Layer-wise isomorphism:</strong> Each layer in a deep net can be viewed as a model of the data at a specific scale.</li> <li><strong>Capacity for novelty:</strong> Successive layers do not merely copy information; they compute novel models of the data built off of interactions between lower-level models.</li> </ul> <p>This suggests that to model the world at increasingly large scales — moving from single images to long-form video or life-long streams — we may need architectures that can deepen unboundedly, continuously capturing new structure as it emerges.</p> <h2 id="the-time-dimension-open-endedness-and-data-curricula">The time dimension: open-endedness and data curricula</h2> <p>While standard machine learning focuses on <em>iid</em> datasets, humans are generally confronted with data that extends deep in time and grows in complexity. Knowledge in the real world isn’t just static; it <em>grows</em> compositionally. New concepts (like calculus) are not learned in isolation but are refactored on top of existing ones (like algebra).</p> <p>Our definition provides a rigorous test for whether a data curriculum is truly open-ended. Consider a data stream $x$ decomposed into history $x_a$ and a new observation $x_b$:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Redundancy ($m_x = m_{x_a}$):</strong> If $x_b$ adds no new patterns, learning stalls.</li> <li><strong>Disorder ($m_x = [m_{x_a}, m_{x_b}]$):</strong> If $x_b$ is unrelated to history (random noise or isolated facts about the world), the model effectively resorts to brute-force memorization.</li> <li><strong>Compositional growth ($K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b}) &gt; 0$):</strong> This occurs only when the new observation $x_b$ shares structure with history $x_a$ in a way that forces the global model $m_x$ to evolve or refactor. Such data allows a world model to grow in a hierarchical way that efficiently leverages past experience, and allows new experiences to shape its understanding of old ones.</li> </ul> <blockquote class="notice--primary" style="font-size:0.9em !important"> <p><strong>Box: Fractured/Entangled vs. Unified/Factored representations</strong></p> <p>This perspective has implications for a fascinating new paper “Questioning Representational Optimism in Deep Learning: The Fractured Entangled Representation Hypothesis” by Kumar et al. <d-cite key="kumar_questioning_2025"></d-cite>, which found that neural representations which arise from open-ended curricula demonstrate significantly more compositional structure than those of models trained only on the final endpoints of these curricula.</p> <p>One conclusion the authors draw is that compression, while important, is not the only thing that a model should strive for — after all, the neural network they train on the final endpoint of a curriculum does a good job in terms of compression, but learns poor representations nonetheless. Our theory of compositionality suggests a different conclusion, however: optimal compression is <em>always</em> what we should strive for when modeling, but crucially a <em>curriculum might have significantly more compositional structure than its endpoint, and its optimal compression might therefore capture this compositional structure far better</em>.</p> <p>Take school curricula again, for instance. If our understanding of calculus builds off of prior concepts in algebra, we’ll be better able to jointly compress <em>both</em> through concept reuse. In contrast, if our only goal was to develop a compressed model of calculus in isolation, who knows what it would look like (imagine having learned calculus without knowing algebra first; you would certainly think of it in a very different way). There’s a crucial difference between compressing an entire curriculum versus compressing its endpoint alone. All of these interpretations of Kumar et al.’s fascinating findings are testable, and have important consequences for machine learning and the role of open-ended curricula.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="visualizing-and-defining-intrinsic-structure">Visualizing and defining intrinsic structure</h2> <p>To move beyond abstract equations, we can map these concepts into <strong>compositional structure diagrams</strong>. These are tree-based visualizations where branches represent the merging of parts, and the height of a branch represents the quantity of novel structure $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b})$ emerging at that merge.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig8-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig8-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig8-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-compositionality/fig8.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption" style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;"> <strong>Figure 8: Compositional structure diagrams.</strong> A diagram that shows how compositional structure emerges at different scales in an object, according to a recursive decomposition (legend in the top left of the figure). A given node represents a substring of the entire object, and branches represent substrings merging to form a larger string. The height of a branch above a merge point represents the amount of novel compositional structure that emerges from that combination of substrings (heights of branches below a merge point do not represent anything, and just vary to improve spacing in the diagram). Note: in order to keep the diagram clean, we’re not showing the intermediate binary joins that don’t generate significant novel structure. </div> <p>This kind of visualization of our definition shows us how larger structures are built off of novel structure shared at smaller scales — like how concepts build off of others — and it shows us how this happens recursively through the object. There’s a nice analogy to be made to phylogenetic trees in biology, but whereas phylogenetic trees show a plausible story of how genetic structure diverges over time and splits off into new species, compositional structure diagrams show a plausible story of how structures merge to form novel ones (which, according to a recent theory of evolution called symbiogenesis <d-cite key="arcas_what_2025"></d-cite>, might actually be how we should think of phylogenetic histories in the first place).</p> <p><strong>The “maximal tree” hypothesis</strong> A central question remains: <em>which</em> hierarchical decomposition is the “correct” one? While the answer may depend on the domain, we propose that the <strong>maximal tree</strong> decomposition — the one that maximizes the sum of novel structure at every node — is the most scientifically interesting candidate for an object’s intrinsic structure.</p> <p>We favor the maximal tree $T_{max}(x)$ for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Intuition and non-triviality:</strong> It inherently groups parts that maximize shared structure, avoiding arbitrary cuts. In contrast, if we were looking at <em>minimal</em> trees, we would be joining objects that are either structurally identical or algorithmically independent.</li> <li><strong>Different from sophistication:</strong> There exists objects with the same sophistication $K(m_x)$ but <em>different</em> sums of compositionality terms under the maximal tree decomposition. This means that when we consider the maximal tree, our measure of compositionality does not simply reduce to sophistication — it quantifies a <em>kind</em> of structure rather than just the total amount of structure. The opposite is true for <em>minimal</em> trees: there is always a trivial solution that merges every individual bit of a string in one single merge, resulting in a sum of compositionality terms equal to $K(m_x)$.</li> <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> It has a kind of recursive consistent: compositional substrings retain their structure under the maximal tree when embedded in larger compositional objects.</li> </ul> <h2 id="practical-use-estimation-and-design">Practical use: estimation and design</h2> <p>Finally, we must address the elephant in the room: Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable. Does this render the definition useless? Absolutely not.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Estimation via compression:</strong> Just as we upper-bound Kolmogorov complexity with concrete compression algorithms like ZIP or PAQ, we can estimate compositionality using standard learning algorithms and compressors.</li> <li><strong>A normative north star:</strong> Even without precise measurement, the definition guides design. It shifts the focus from purely architectural inductive biases toward <strong>data-centric compositionality</strong>. It suggests that the bottleneck to general AI isn’t just how we learn from data, but ensuring we collect data streams rich enough to satisfy $K(m_x \mid m_{x_a}, m_{x_b}) &gt; 0$ continuously over time.</li> </ol> <hr/> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>Our work on formally defining compositionality did not start out of nowhere: it arose for a particular reason. We were interested in designing models that can flexibly generalize like humans do when we think, dynamically composing concepts in order to adapt to novel situations. The further we got into these projects, however, the more we felt like we no longer understood the original goal, unable to explain what the scientific problems were or why the approaches we were pursuing would work. Eventually, we started to realize that we take compositionality for granted, using it in our vocabulary for talking about AI without having any real clue as to what it means.</p> <p>This work has filled that conceptual gap for us, and given us renewed clarity on our research and scientific interests. We hope that it can serve a similar purpose for others in the field who are reading this blog post and interested in compositionality. However, like all scientific formalisms, we think that the real significance of these ideas lies in the serendipitous directions they may lead future research. For us, having a new way to think and talk about compositionality more precisely has opened the flood gates: we see new research ideas, applications, and connections to other fields everywhere we look. We’ve tried to highlight some of these here, but our biggest hope in writing this blog post is that it has a similar stimulating effect for others, and that research into compositionality benefits from a new pool of creative ideas.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compositionality is thought to be crucial in human cognition and AI, but we lack a scientific understanding of what it is.

Let \(\mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{conv}}_{G}\) be the class of <strong>translation-equivariant, finite-support Toeplitz operators</strong> (U-Net convolutional kernels) and \(\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{attn}}\) the class of <strong>self-attention kernels with relative positional structure</strong> (DiTs). Write \(\sqsubseteq^{\mathrm{bias}}\) as “is a constrained instance of (via inductive-bias constraints)”<d-cite key="hornTranslationalEquivarianceKernelizable2021"></d-cite><d-cite key="taiMathematicalExplanationUNet2024"></d-cite>.</p> \[\boxed{ \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{conv}}_{G}\ \sqsubseteq^{\mathrm{bias}}\ \mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{attn}} }\] <p>In plain terms, <strong>convolution is a simplified, efficient expression of attention</strong> obtained by enforcing fixed translation symmetry, parameter tying, and locality<d-cite key="ramachandranStandAloneSelfAttentionVision2019"></d-cite><d-cite key="cordonnierRelationshipSelfAttentionConvolutional2020"></d-cite><d-cite key="changConvolutionsSelfAttentionReinterpreting2021"></d-cite><d-cite key="choiGraphConvolutionsEnrich2024"></d-cite><d-cite key="joshiTransformersAreGraph2025"></d-cite>; removing these constraints yields attention <strong>without a hard-coded translation prior</strong>, allowing DiTs to <em>learn</em> which symmetries and long-range relations matter at scale. This inclusion explains the empirical shift under modern hardware and datasets: attention strictly generalizes convolution while retaining it as an efficient special case, delivering smoother scaling laws and higher semantic “bandwidth” per denoising step. In practice, this is also a story of hardware path dependence: attention’s dense-matrix primitives align with contemporary accelerators and compiler stacks, effectively “winning” the hardware lottery <d-cite key="hookerHardwareLottery2021"></d-cite>. And, echoing the Bitter Lesson<d-cite key="richsuttonBitterLesson2019"></d-cite>, as data and compute grow, general methods with fewer hand-engineered priors dominate—making attention’s strict generalization of convolution the natural backbone at scale.</p> <h2 id="further-discussion">Further Discussion</h2> <h3 id="from-text-to-image-generation-to-real-world-applications">From Text-to-Image Generation to Real-World Applications</h3> <p>Text-to-image is now genuinely strong; the next wave is about <strong>conditioning existing pixels</strong> rather than generating from scratch—turning models into reliable editors that honor what must stay and change only what’s asked. This means prioritizing downstream tasks like image editing, inpainting/outpainting, image-to-image restyling, and structure- or reference-guided synthesis (edges, depth, layout, style, identity). The practical focus shifts from unconstrained novelty to controllable, faithful rewrites with tight mask adherence, robust subject/style preservation, and interactive latencies, so these systems plug cleanly into real creative, design, and industrial workflows.</p> <h3 id="diffusion-models-vs-auto-regressive-models">Diffusion Models vs. Auto-regressive Models</h3> <p>Diffusion models and autoregressive (AR) models represent two fundamentally different approaches to image generation, with the key distinction being that <strong>autoregressive models operate on discrete image tokens</strong> while <strong>diffusion models work with continuous representations</strong>. Autoregressive models like DALL-E <d-cite key="rameshZeroShotTexttoImageGeneration2021"></d-cite>, CogView <d-cite key="dingCogViewMasteringTexttoImage2021"></d-cite>, and CogView2 <d-cite key="dingCogView2FasterBetter2022"></d-cite> treat image generation as a sequence modeling problem, encoding images into discrete tokens using VQ-VAE <d-cite key="esserTamingTransformersHighResolution2021"></d-cite> or similar vector quantization methods, then autoregressively predicting the next token given previous tokens. This approach offers sequential generation with precise control and natural language integration, but suffers from slow generation, error accumulation, and discrete representation loss. In contrast, diffusion models operate directly on continuous pixel or latent representations, learning to reverse a gradual noise corruption process, which enables parallel generation, high-quality outputs, and flexible conditioning, though at the cost of computational overhead and less direct control. Recent advances have significantly improved autoregressive approaches: VAR <d-cite key="tianVisualAutoregressiveModeling2024"></d-cite> redefines autoregressive learning as coarse-to-fine “next-scale prediction” and achieves superior performance compared to diffusion transformers, while Infinity <d-cite key="hanInfinityScalingBitwise2025"></d-cite> demonstrates effective scaling of bitwise autoregressive modeling for high-resolution synthesis. Additionally, MAR <d-cite key="liAutoregressiveImageGeneration2024a"></d-cite> bridges the gap between paradigms by adopting diffusion loss for autoregressive models, enabling continuous-valued autoregressive generation without vector quantization. Recent work has also explored hybrid approaches that combine both paradigms: HunyuanImage 3.0 <d-cite key="caoHunyuanImage30Technical2025"></d-cite> and BLIP3-o <d-cite key="chenBLIP3oFamilyFully2025"></d-cite> demonstrate unified multimodal models within autoregressive frameworks while incorporating diffusion-inspired techniques, while OmniGen <d-cite key="xiaoOmniGenUnifiedImage2024"></d-cite> and OmniGen2 <d-cite key="wuOmniGen2ExplorationAdvanced2025"></d-cite> use diffusion models as backbones for unified generation capabilities.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog post’s knowledge cutoff is November 17, 2025.

The fundamental difficulty is that many such problems are <strong>ill-posed</strong>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Non-uniqueness:</strong> if \(\mathbf{A}\) is rank-deficient or severely underdetermined, many different \(\mathbf{x}\) produce the same \(\mathbf{y}\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Instability:</strong> when \(\mathbf{A}\) is ill-conditioned, small perturbations in \(\mathbf{y}\) can cause large changes in the reconstructed \(\mathbf{x}\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>If we ignore prior knowledge and rely solely on the measurements to solve via maximum likelihood estimation</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MLE}} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{x}} \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2,\] <p>it yields the solution either does not exist, is not unique, or is extremely sensitive to noise. This motivates <strong>regularization</strong>: we bias the solution toward signals that are “plausible” under our prior knowledge. In probabilistic form, this leads to <strong>Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)</strong> estimation</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{x}} \left[ \underbrace{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2}_{\text{Data Consistency}} \quad + \underbrace{\lambda R(\mathbf{x})}_{\text{Prior / Regularization}} \right],\] <p>where \(R(\mathbf{x})\) is a regularizer encoding the prior, and \(\lambda &gt; 0\) controls the trade-off between data fidelity and prior strength.</p> <p>From this perspective, the history of solving inverse problems is essentially the history of designing better functions for $R(\mathbf{x})$ — from handcrafted mathematical assumptions to data-driven generative manifolds.</p> <h3 id="11-handcrafted-analytical-priors">1.1. Handcrafted Analytical Priors</h3> <p>Before the era of deep learning, priors were designed based on mathematical and statistical intuition about natural signals.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Smoothness priors (Tikhonov / Gaussian):</strong><br/> Assuming that \(\mathbf{x}\) varies smoothly, one uses \(R(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{L}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2\) for some differential or finite-difference operator \(\mathbf{L}\). This corresponds to a Gaussian prior and leads to classical Tikhonov regularization <d-cite key="tikhonov1977solutions"></d-cite>. Such priors are stable and convex, but they oversmooth edges and cannot hallucinate missing high-frequency details.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Total Variation (TV) and piecewise-smooth priors:</strong><br/> To better preserve edges, TV replaces the quadratic penalty with an \(\ell_1\)-type penalty on gradients, e.g., \(R(\mathbf{x}) = \|\nabla \mathbf{x}\|_1.\) TV assumes that images are mostly smooth with sparse sharp transitions, which works well for piecewise-constant structures but can introduce “staircase” artifacts and still struggles with fine textures.<d-cite key="rudin1992nonlinear"></d-cite></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sparsity priors (wavelets, dictionary learning):</strong><br/> Another line of work assumes that \(\mathbf{x}\) is sparse in a suitable transform domain, such as wavelets or learned dictionaries, leading to penalties like \(R(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x}\|_1,\) where \(\mathbf{W}\) is a fixed or learned transform. These priors capture certain classes of textures and edges, but still act as <strong>handcrafted surrogates</strong> for the true (and highly complex) distribution of natural signals.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All of these classical priors are <strong>analytical</strong>: they are given by explicit formulas chosen by the designer. They are computationally convenient and theoretically well understood, but ultimately limited in expressiveness. They can discourage obviously “bad” solutions, yet they do not truly know what realistic images look like.</p> <h3 id="12-explicit-generative-manifolds">1.2. Explicit Generative Manifolds</h3> <p>With the rise of deep generative models, we no longer had to <strong>guess</strong> analytical forms for \(R(\mathbf{x})\). Instead, we could <strong>learn</strong> the data distribution directly from examples, and then use that model as a prior.</p> <p>A common idea is the <strong>manifold constraint</strong>: assume that plausible signals lie near the range of a generator \(G(\mathbf{z})\), where \(\mathbf{z}\) is a low-dimensional latent code. Rather than optimizing directly over \(\mathbf{x}\), we optimize over \(\mathbf{z}\):</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{z}} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{z}} \left[ \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A}(G(\mathbf{z}))\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\mathbf{z}\|_2^2 \right], \qquad \hat{\mathbf{x}} = G(\hat{\mathbf{z}}).\] <p>Different generative models instantiate this idea in different ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>GANs <d-cite key="goodfellow2014generative"></d-cite>:</strong> Adversarial training yields highly realistic samples and sharp details. However, mode collapse and training instability make the learned manifold incomplete: if the ground-truth \(\mathbf{x}\) is not well covered by the generator, optimization in \(\mathbf{z}\) may fail or converge to a visually plausible but incorrect solution.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>VAEs <d-cite key="kingma2013auto"></d-cite>:</strong> VAEs provide a probabilistic decoder \(p_\theta(\mathbf{x}\mid \mathbf{z})\) with a simple prior on \(\mathbf{z}\) (often Gaussian). Their reconstructions are typically smoother and more stable than GANs but tend to be <strong>blurry</strong>, reflecting the ELBO objective’s tendency to average over modes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normalizing Flows <d-cite key="dinh2016density,kingma2018glow"></d-cite> and related models:</strong> Flows provide exact likelihoods and invertible mappings, so in principle they offer a very clean way to define \(p(\mathbf{x})\). In practice, however, they impose architectural constraints (e.g., invertibility and tractable Jacobians), and solving inverse problems with them often requires expensive Jacobian–vector products or MCMC steps.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In all these cases, the prior is no longer an explicit penalty \(R(\mathbf{x})\) but an <strong>implicit manifold</strong> traced out by a neural generator. This brings much richer structure but also introduces new optimization and modeling challenges: enforcing measurement consistency while staying on (or near) the learned manifold is nontrivial.</p> <h3 id="13-the-shift-to-diffusion-prior">1.3. The Shift to Diffusion Prior</h3> <p>Both previous families of priors have clear trade-offs:</p> <ul> <li>Classical analytical priors are <strong>stable, convex, and easy to optimize</strong>, but they are too simple to faithfully model complex natural images.</li> <li>Explicit generative manifolds are <strong>expressive</strong> and can synthesize highly realistic samples, but they are often <strong>hard to optimize against</strong> and can be brittle outside the training distribution.</li> </ul> <p>Diffusion models <d-cite key="ho2020denoising,song2020score"></d-cite> offer a different compromise. Instead of defining a single deterministic manifold or a closed-form regularizer, they define a <strong>stochastic generative process</strong> that gradually transforms simple noise into data through a sequence of Gaussian denoising steps. Conceptually, they give us:</p> <ul> <li>A powerful, flexible <strong>prior over signals</strong>, encoded by a learned score or denoiser.</li> <li>A natural way to <strong>interleave prior-driven denoising with measurement-driven corrections</strong> along the sampling trajectory.</li> </ul> <p>This “dynamic” view of the prior—where we guide a stochastic or deterministic trajectory through noisy space—makes diffusion models particularly attractive for inverse problems. It allows us to inject measurement information <strong>gradually</strong>, to decouple a pretrained diffusion prior from the forward operator \(\mathbf{A}\), and to design algorithms that behave more like <strong>operator-splitting schemes</strong> than hard manifold projection. The rest of this post develops this perspective in detail.</p> <h2 id="2-diffusion-priors-for-inverse-problems">2. Diffusion priors for inverse problems</h2> <p>In the background section we framed inverse problems as Bayesian inference with a prior over clean signals \(\mathbf{x}_0\) and a likelihood induced by the forward operator \(\mathbf{A}\). With a diffusion model, this prior is no longer given by an explicit energy \(R(\mathbf{x}_0)\) or a simple manifold parameterization \(G(\mathbf{z})\). Instead, it is encoded in a <strong>stochastic generative process</strong> that gradually transforms Gaussian noise into data. This section explains how that process works and why it makes inverse problems both powerful and subtle.</p> <h3 id="21-bayesian-gold-standard-with-a-diffusion-prior">2.1. Bayesian “gold standard” with a diffusion prior</h3> <p>Consider again the inverse problem where the measurement is generated from a forward model \(\mathbf{y} \sim p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0),\) with \(\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p(\mathbf{x}_0)\) given by a diffusion prior. In the simplest case we assume additive Gaussian noise (Eq. \eqref{eq:ip}), so that</p> \[p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0) \propto \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0\|_2^2\Big).\] <p>By Bayes’ rule, the posterior over clean signals is</p> \[p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{y}) \;\propto\; p(\mathbf{y}\mid\mathbf{x}_0)\,p(\mathbf{x}_0).\] <p>If we could evaluate \(\log p(\mathbf{x}_0)\) and its gradient exactly, the <strong>Bayesian gold standard</strong> would be the MAP estimator</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\max_{\mathbf{x}_0} \left[ \underbrace{\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0)}_{\text{Data fidelity}} + \underbrace{\log p(\mathbf{x}_0)}_{\text{Prior}} \right]. \tag{2.1}\label{eq:obj}\] <p>Conceptually this is straightforward: we simply trade off how well \(\mathbf{x}_0\) explains the measurement \(\mathbf{y}\) versus how plausible \(\mathbf{x}_0\) is under the diffusion prior. In practice, diffusion models make this optimization non-trivial, because the prior is not defined directly in the clean space \(\mathbf{x}_0\).</p> <h3 id="22-diffusion-models-live-in-noisy-space">2.2. Diffusion models live in noisy space</h3> <p>A modern diffusion model is trained in a <strong>noisy</strong> space. One common continuous-time formulation uses a forward SDE</p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,dt + g(t)\,d\mathbf{w}_t, \qquad t\in[0,1],\] <p>where \(\mathbf{x}_0\) is a clean data sample, \(\mathbf{x}_1\) is approximately Gaussian noise, and \(\mathbf{w}_t\) is standard Brownian motion. The forward SDE defines a family of intermediate marginals \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) that smoothly interpolate between the data distribution at \(t=0\) and a simple reference (typically Gaussian) at \(t=1\). Training learns a <strong>score network</strong></p> \[s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t) \approx \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t),\] <p>i.e., a vector field that points in the direction of steeper log-density at each noise level. Geometrically, the score pushes samples uphill towards regions of higher probability. At generation time, we can run the <strong>reverse-time SDE</strong> <d-cite key="anderson1982reverse"></d-cite></p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = \Big[f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) - g^2(t)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\Big]\,dt + g(t)\,d\bar{\mathbf{w}}_t,\] <p>from \(t=1\) (pure noise) to \(t=0\) (clean data), where \(\bar{\mathbf{w}}_t\) is a standard Brownian motion in reversed time. Alternatively, Song et al. <d-cite key="song2020score"></d-cite> showed that there exists a deterministic <strong>probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE)</strong></p> \[\frac{d\mathbf{x}_t}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\,\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t),\] <p>whose solution curves share the same marginals \(\{p_t\}_{t\in[0,1]}\) as the stochastic SDE. Intuitively, the SDE adds randomness while the ODE simply transports probability mass along the same flow.</p> <p>Crucially, all of these objects – the forward SDE, the reverse SDE, and the PF-ODE – are defined in terms of the <strong>noisy</strong> variables \(\mathbf{x}_t\) and their densities \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\). The prior \(p(\mathbf{x}_0)\) only appears implicitly as the marginal at time zero of this process. This creates a mismatch for inverse problems:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The likelihood \(p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0)\) in Eq. \eqref{eq:obj} is naturally written in the <strong>clean space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_0\).</p> </li> <li> <p>The diffusion prior is only directly accessible through scores \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) in the <strong>noisy space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_t\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>The rest of this blogpost can be read as a sequence of techniques for bridging this gap: how to couple measurement information with a prior that lives along a diffusion trajectory.</p> <h3 id="23-tweedies-estimator-as-a-clean-space-anchor">2.3. Tweedie’s estimator as a clean-space anchor</h3> <p>A key tool for connecting noisy and clean spaces is <strong>Tweedie’s formula</strong>. In the simplest (and widely used) setting, the forward diffusion at time \(t\) can be written as</p> \[\mathbf{x}_t = \alpha(t)\,\mathbf{x}_0 + \sigma(t)\,\boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \qquad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}),\] <p>where \(\alpha(t)\) and \(\sigma(t)\) are scalar functions that control the signal and noise levels. Under this Gaussian corruption model, Tweedie’s formula tells us that the posterior mean of the clean signal given a noisy observation \(\mathbf{x}_t\) is</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t) \;=\; \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}_0\mid\mathbf{x}_t] \;=\; \frac{\mathbf{x}_t + \sigma^2(t)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)}{\alpha(t)}.\] <p>Here \(s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t) \approx \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) is the score learned by the diffusion model. Thus, once the diffusion prior is trained, we can <em>decode</em> any noisy point \(\mathbf{x}_t\) into a corresponding <strong>clean-space estimate</strong> \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) using only the score network.</p> <p>From a statistical perspective, \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) is the <strong>minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)</strong> estimator of \(\mathbf{x}_0\) given \(\mathbf{x}_t\): among all possible functions of \(\mathbf{x}_t\), it minimizes the expected squared error</p> \[\mathbb{E}\big[\|\mathbf{x}_0 - \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\|_2^2\big].\] <p>It is therefore a principled, Bayes-optimal representative of the posterior distribution over \(\mathbf{x}_0\) for that particular noise level. From a geometric perspective, we can interpret \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) as a kind of <strong>clean-space anchor</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Let \(M_0\) denote the (unknown) data manifold where the diffusion prior assigns high density at \(t=0\).</li> <li>For a noisy point \(\mathbf{x}_t\), the posterior over \(\mathbf{x}_0\) given \(\mathbf{x}_t\) is typically concentrated near a small region on or near \(M_0\).</li> <li>Tweedie’s estimator \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) sits near the <em>center of mass</em> of that posterior cloud. It lives in a high-density neighborhood of \(M_0\), even if it is not exactly on the manifold, and becomes increasingly accurate as \(\sigma(t)\to 0\).</li> </ul> <p>We will repeatedly exploit this anchor in later sections:</p> <ul> <li> <p>In <strong>posterior-guided sampling</strong> (Section 3), we use Tweedie’s estimator to approximate <em>posterior</em> scores in noisy space, enabling us to modify the reverse SDE/ODE so that it samples from an approximation to \(p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid\mathbf{y})\).</p> </li> <li> <p>In <strong>clean-space Local-MAP optimization</strong> (Section 4), we treat \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) as a good initialization in clean space and locally refine it to better satisfy the measurement constraints.</p> </li> </ul> <figure class="figure"> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-diffusion-inverse-problems/tweedie_anchor_sine.gif" alt="Posterior-guided sampling: prior vs naive guidance vs Jacobian guidance" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; image-rendering: auto;"/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Animation 1: Tweedie denoising as a clean-space anchor. </div> <p><strong>Animated illustration – posterior mean vs. data manifold.</strong><br/> Consider a simple 2D sine-shaped data manifold \(M_0\) and a single clean point \(\mathbf{x}_0\) on it.

Posterior-Guided Sampling Paradigm</h2> <p>In this section, we focus on <strong>posterior-guided sampling</strong>, a family of methods that solve inverse problems by directly sampling from the Bayesian posterior under a diffusion prior, exemplified by DPS <d-cite key="chung2022diffusion"></d-cite> and MCG methods <d-cite key="chung2022improving"></d-cite>. The key idea is extremely simple:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p>Take the reverse-time dynamics of the diffusion model, and replace the <strong>prior score</strong> \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) with the <strong>posterior score</strong> \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\).</p> </aside> <p>Concretely, recall the probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) associated with the forward SDE</p> \[\frac{d\mathbf{x}_t}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) -\frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t), \qquad s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\approx \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t),\] <p>whose solution at \(t=0\) recovers samples from the data distribution \(p_{\text{data}}\).

Why Inverse Problems Can Be Solved by Sampling</h3> <p>We first revisit why <strong>sampling</strong> from a suitable reverse-time process solves not only the unconditional generative problem, but also the <strong>inverse problem</strong>.</p> <p>We begin with the <strong>unconditional</strong> case. Let \(\{ \mathbf{x}_t \}_{t\in[0,T]}\) be a trajectory followed by the forward diffusion SDE,</p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,dt + g(t)\,d\mathbf{w}_t,\qquad \mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_{\text{data}},\] <p>with marginal densities \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\). These densities satisfy the <strong>Fokker–Planck equation</strong></p> \[\partial_t p_t(\mathbf{x}_t) = -\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\!\cdot\!\big(f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\big) +\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}^2\!\big(g^2(t)\,p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\big).\] <p>Song et al. <d-cite key="song2020score,anderson1982reverse"></d-cite> showed that there exists both a <strong>reverse-time SDE</strong> and an equivalent <strong>PF-ODE</strong> whose marginals evolve backward in time but follow the <strong>same</strong> family of densities \(\{p_t\}\). In particular, the PF-ODE</p> \[\frac{d\mathbf{x}_t}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\,\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\] <p>satisfies the same Fokker–Planck equation as the forward SDE, but with time running from \(t=1\) back to \(t=0\).

The Jacobian as an approximate tangent-space projector</h3> <p>The key takeaway from Eq. \eqref{eq:lik} is that the Jacobian of the Tweedie denoiser does not act in an arbitrary way: under the standard “data lie near a smooth manifold” assumption and in the small-noise regime, it behaves <strong>approximately</strong> like a projection onto the tangent space of the data manifold. This is exactly what we want for inverse problems: the likelihood gradient should pull us <strong>along</strong> the manifold rather than pushing us off it.</p> <p>To make this precise, assume that clean data concentrate near a smooth $d_0$-dimensional manifold $M_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. For notational simplicity, work in local coordinates around some point $x^\star \in M_0$ and decompose any nearby point as</p> \[x_t = x^\star + u + n,\] <p>where $u \in T_{x^\star} M_0$ is the tangent component and $n \perp T_{x^\star} M_0$ is the normal component.</p> <p>In the small-noise regime with Gaussian corruption $x_t = x_0 + \sigma \varepsilon$, $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$, a standard manifold argument (see e.g. denoising-score literature) shows that the log-density of $x_t$ can be approximated as</p> \[\log p_t(x_t) \;\approx\; C(u) \;-\; \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\,\|n\|^2,\] <p>where $C(u)$ varies slowly along the manifold and the quadratic term penalizes distance in the normal direction. Consequently, the score is approximately</p> \[\nabla_{x_t} \log p_t(x_t) \;\approx\; -\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\,n,\] <p>i.e., it points back toward the manifold by cancelling the normal offset $n$. Plugging this into Tweedie’s formula,</p> \[\hat x_0(x_t,t) = x_t + \sigma^2 \nabla_{x_t} \log p_t(x_t),\] <p>we obtain, to first order,</p> \[\hat x_0(x_t,t) \;\approx\; x_t + \sigma^2\Big(-\frac{1}{\sigma^2} n\Big) = x_t - n = x^\star + u.\] <p>In other words, when the noise is small and the model is accurate, the Tweedie denoiser $\hat x_0(x_t,t)$ behaves like the <strong>nearest-point projection</strong> onto the data manifold:</p> \[\hat x_0(x_t,t) \;\approx\; \Pi(x_t) \;:=\; \arg\min_{z \in M_0} \|z - x_t\|_2^2.\] <p>For this nearest-point projection map $\Pi$, classical differential geometry tells us that its Jacobian at a point $x_t$ whose projection is $x^\star = \Pi(x_t)$ is the orthogonal projector onto the tangent space $T_{x^\star} M_0$:</p> \[D\Pi(x_t) = P_{T_{x^\star} M_0}.\] <p>Intuitively, a small perturbation $\delta x_t$ of the input decomposes into</p> \[\delta x_t = \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}} + \delta x_{\mathrm{nor}}, \quad \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}} \in T_{x^\star} M_0,\; \delta x_{\mathrm{nor}} \perp T_{x^\star} M_0.\] <p>Under the projection, the tangent component moves the projected point along the manifold, while the normal component is largely “forgotten”:</p> \[D\Pi(x_t)\,\delta x_t \;\approx\; \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}}.\] <p>Since Tweedie’s denoiser $\hat x_0(x_t,t)$ is, in the small-noise limit, a smooth perturbation of this nearest-point projection, its Jacobian $J_{\hat x_0}(x_t) = \partial \hat x_0 / \partial x_t$ inherits the same behavior:</p> \[J_{\hat x_0}(x_t)\,\delta x_t \;\approx\; \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}},\] <p>i.e., it <strong>keeps</strong> the tangent component and <strong>suppresses</strong> the normal component of any perturbation.</p> <p>Plugging this geometric picture back into Eq. \eqref{eq:lik}, we can reinterpret the likelihood score as</p> \[\nabla_{x_t}\log p(y \mid x_t) \;\approx\; \underbrace{J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)}_{\text{tangent-space projector}}\, \underbrace{\nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0)\big|_{x_0=\hat x_0(x_t,t)}}_{\text{clean-space DC gradient}}.\] <p>Geometrically:</p> <ol> <li> <p>We first compute a <strong>clean-space data-consistency gradient</strong></p> \[g_{x_0} = \nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} A^\top (y - A \hat x_0),\] <p>which tells us how to move $\hat x_0$ to better match the measurement.</p> </li> <li> <p>We then apply $J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)$, which approximately projects this gradient onto the tangent space $T_{\hat x_0} M_0$, removing its normal component.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The resulting likelihood score in noisy space moves $x_t$ in a direction that (i) improves data consistency because it originates from $g_{x_0}$, and (ii) remains compatible with the diffusion prior because its normal component has been suppressed. In this approximate sense, the Jacobian of Tweedie’s estimator acts as a <strong>tangent-space projector</strong> for likelihood guidance.</p> <h3 id="34-2d-toy-illustration">3.4. 2D Toy Illustration</h3> <p>To make the geometric effect of the Jacobian term more concrete, we visualize a toy 2D inverse problem where the clean data lie on a sine-shaped manifold \(M_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^2\). We fix a single target point \(x_0^\star \in M_0\) (red star) that is consistent with the measurement \(\mathbf{y}\), and start the reverse diffusion from a noisy point far away from the manifold. At each reverse-time step we consider three different update rules, corresponding to three panels in the animation.</p> <figure class="figure"> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-diffusion-inverse-problems/posterior_guided_sampling.gif" alt="Posterior-guided sampling: prior vs naive guidance vs Jacobian guidance" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; image-rendering: auto;"/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Animation 2: Clean-space local-MAP as a denoise–optimize–re-noise scheme. </div> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Prior-only dynamics (left).</strong> In the first panel we ignore the measurement and only follow the diffusion <strong>prior score</strong>. Geometrically, this score always pulls the current state \(x_t\) back towards the nearest point on the learned manifold \(M_0\). The trajectory (purple) quickly relaxes to some high-density region of the prior, but this point has no reason to satisfy the measurement. This corresponds to unconditional sampling: we solve the generative problem, not the inverse problem.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prior + naive guidance in noisy space (middle).</strong> In the second panel we add a <strong>naive likelihood guidance</strong> term directly in the ambient space, approximating the posterior score as</p> \[\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t \mid y) \;\approx\; s_\theta(x_t,t) \;+\; \underbrace{\nabla_{x_t} \log p(y \mid x_t)}_{\text{naive DC term}}.\] <p>The blue arrow shows the prior score \(s*\theta(x_t,t)\), which pulls \(x_t\) back to the manifold, while the orange arrow is the guidance vector pointing towards the target. Because this guidance is defined in the ambient space, it typically has a large normal component and <strong>pushes the trajectory off the manifold</strong>. As a result, the two forces frequently oppose each other (“guidance fights prior”), leading to zig-zag trajectories that cut across low-density regions and visibly leave \(M_0\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prior + Jacobian-guided likelihood (right).</strong> In the third panel we use the Tweedie denoiser \(\hat x_0(x_t,t)\) as a clean-space anchor, compute the <strong>clean-space measurement gradient</strong> \(\nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0)\) at \(x_0 = \hat x_0\), and then map it back to the noisy space via the Jacobian:</p> \[\nabla_{x_t}\log p(y \mid x_t) \;\approx\; J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)\, \nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0)\Big|_{x_0=\hat x_0(x_t,t)}.\] <p>As argued in the previous subsection, the Jacobian \(J_{\hat x_0}(x_t)\) behaves like a <strong>projection onto the tangent space</strong> \(T_{\hat x_0} M_0\). In the animation, this means the orange guidance arrow is no longer allowed to point arbitrarily into the ambient space: it is projected to lie <strong>along the manifold</strong>, while the blue prior score keeps \(x_t\) attached to \(M_0\). The resulting posterior-guided trajectory slides along the sine curve toward the target, achieving data consistency <em>without</em> drifting away from the learned generative manifold.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This toy example illustrates the core role of the Jacobian term in posterior-guided sampling: it converts a clean-space likelihood gradient into a noisy-space correction that is automatically constrained to the tangent space of the data manifold. In practice, this allows us to approximate the posterior score as</p> \[\nabla_{x_t}\log p(x_t \mid y) \;\approx\; s_\theta(x_t,t) \;+\; J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)\, \nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0),\] <p>so that the prior and likelihood contribute <strong>compatible</strong> vector fields—one keeps us on the manifold, the other moves us along it toward solutions that both match the measurements and remain realistic under the diffusion prior.</p> <h2 id="4-local-map-optimization-paradigm">4. Local-MAP optimization Paradigm</h2> <p>The posterior-guided sampling paradigm views inverse problems as a <strong>sampling task</strong>: we try to simulate a posterior diffusion process in noisy space and read off samples from $p(\mathbf{x}_0 \mid \mathbf{y})$ at $t = 0$.

Toy Illustration: Local-MAP as Denoise–Optimize–Re-noise</h3> <p>To make the local-MAP paradigm concrete, we build a simple 2D toy example and visualize one full reverse trajectory as an animation, see Animation 3.</p> <p>We place clean data on a 1D “sine-wave” manifold \(M_0 = \{(u, \sin u): u \in \mathbb{R}\}\) (Please note that $M_0$ refers to $M_{\text{DM}}$), which plays the role of a toy diffusion prior: clean samples concentrate near this curve. The forward operator is a 1D linear measurement \(\mathbf{A} = [\cos\phi,\; \sin\phi],\) so the set of points consistent with a given measurement \(y\) forms a <strong>slanted observation line</strong></p> \[M_{\mathrm{obs}} = \{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = y\}.\] <p>We pick a ground-truth point \(\mathbf{x}_0^\star \in M_0\) and set \(y = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0^\star\), so the red star in the animation marks the intersection \(M_0 \cap M_{\mathrm{obs}}\) — the ideal MAP solution.</p> <p>The purple curve traces the noisy trajectory \(\{\mathbf{x}_t\}_{t=1\to 0}\). We initialize it at a point far away from \(\mathbf{x}_0^\star\) in the upper-right corner. As the reverse process proceeds, the trajectory gradually bends towards the red star, illustrating how repeated local-MAP updates can still recover the correct solution even without solving a global optimization problem.</p> <p>Each reverse-time step in the animation is decomposed into three colored moves, directly mirroring the <strong>denoise–optimize–re-noise</strong> structure in Sec. 4.2: <strong>Purple (\(x_t\))</strong> represents current noisy state, <strong>Blue (\(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0\))</strong> represents Tweedie denoising anchor, <strong>Orange (\(\mathbf{x}_0^\mathrm{local}\))</strong> represents local MAP refinement in clean space, and finally, we re-noise \(\mathbf{x}_0^\mathrm{local}\) to obtain the next noisy state <strong>Purple (\(x_{t-1}\))</strong>.</p> <figure class="figure"> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-diffusion-inverse-problems/local_map_2d_slanted_obs.gif" alt="Posterior-guided sampling: prior vs naive guidance vs Jacobian guidance" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; image-rendering: auto;"/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Animation 3: Clean-space local-MAP as a denoise–optimize–re-noise scheme. </div> <p>To complement the static 2D toy example, we provide an interactive 3D visualization of the <strong>clean-space Local-MAP paradigm</strong> (see the following Interactive Figure). The blue bowl-shaped surface represents the diffusion prior manifold \(M_{\mathrm{DM}}\), modeled here as an anisotropic Gaussian energy landscape. The light orange plane is the observation manifold \(M_{\mathrm{obs}}\), corresponding to a one-dimensional linear measurement operator \(y = A x\). Their intersection encodes the ideal posterior manifold where both the generative prior and the data-consistency constraint are satisfied.</p> <p>The black curve shows a full <strong>reverse-diffusion trajectory</strong> ({x_t}_{t=T}^{0}) in the clean space. You can type an integer (t) into the input box above the figure to inspect a single reverse step. For each selected time step (t), the visualization highlights the three sub-steps of the Local-MAP update:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A <strong>green segment</strong> connects the current noisy point \(x_t\) to its Tweedie-denoised anchor \(\hat{x}_0^{t}\).</p> </li> <li> <p>A <strong>red segment</strong> connects \(\hat{x}_0^{t}\) to the Local-MAP solution \(\hat{x}_0^{t,*}\).</p> </li> <li> <p>A <strong>blue segment</strong> connects \(\hat{x}_0^{t,*}\) to the next noisy iterate \(x_{t-1}\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>By rotating the 3D view and sweeping \(t\) from large values down to small ones, one can see how Local-MAP repeatedly nudges the reverse trajectory toward the intersection of \(\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{DM}}\) and \(\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{obs}}\) while staying faithful to the diffusion prior.</p> <div class="l-page"> <iframe src="/2026/assets/html/2026-04-27-diffusion-inverse-problems/local_map_interactive.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="600px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Interactive Figure: Local-MAP as Denoise–Optimize–Re-noise.

Conclusion</h2> <p>In this post, we examined diffusion priors for inverse problems through two complementary paradigms: <strong>Posterior-Guided Sampling</strong> and <strong>Local-MAP Optimization</strong>. While the landscape of diffusion inverse solvers is vast <d-dict key="daras2024survey"></d-dict> — including methods based on Variational Inference (VI) <d-cite key="mardani2023variational,alkan2023variational"></d-cite>, latent space optimization <d-cite key="daras2022score,wang2024dmplug"></d-cite>, and asymptotically exact MCMC/SMC approaches <d-cite key="wu2024principled,dou2024diffusion"></d-cite> – but we focused on these two because they have become the most practical and widely used ways to turn a powerful unconditional diffusion model into a plug-and-play inverse solver.</p> <p>At a high level, both paradigms realize the same philosophy:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p><strong>Decouple the generative prior from the measurement physics.</strong></p> </aside> <p>Once a diffusion prior has been trained (once and for all) on natural signals, we can pair it with an arbitrary forward operator \(\mathbf{A}\) and noise model to solve tasks as diverse as inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, and CT reconstruction – without retraining the generative model. What changes from task to task is not the diffusion backbone, but <strong>how we combine a prior operator with a data-consistency operator</strong>.</p> <h3 id="51-posterior-guided-sampling-gradient-based-flows-in-noisy-space">5.1. Posterior-guided sampling: gradient-based flows in noisy space</h3> <p>The posterior-guided paradigm keeps the reverse diffusion entirely in the noisy space \(\mathbf{x}_t\). By replacing the prior score field with the posterior score (Eq. \eqref{eq:posterior_score}), the reverse PF-ODE becomes a gradient-like flow along \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\). The posterior score can be decomposed into two parts, namely the prior score and the likelihood score, this makes posterior-guided sampling look like an <strong>operator splitting</strong> scheme in noisy space: at each step we follow the diffusion prior flow and then apply a data-consistency correction that has been carefully projected onto the manifold’s tangent space.</p> <p>From this perspective, methods such as DPS/DMPS and MCG can be viewed as different instantiations of the same template: they are <strong>gradient-based posterior flows</strong> that operate directly on \(\mathbf{x}_t\).</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Strengths.</strong> Conceptually close to Bayesian posterior sampling; naturally produces <strong>multiple diverse reconstructions</strong> and can, in principle, approximate the full posterior \(p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{y})\). Works well with non-linear or differentiable black-box forward models, as long as we can backpropagate to obtain a likelihood gradient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> Accurate likelihood-score approximations typically require <strong>Jacobian–vector products (JVP) through the Tweedie denoiser</strong>, on top of standard forward passes. This increases memory and compute, especially at high resolution. The dynamics can also be sensitive to guidance strength and discretization; if the likelihood term is not geometrically aligned (e.g. without the Jacobian projection), it may fight against the prior instead of flowing along the data manifold.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="52-local-map-optimization-denoiseoptimizere-noise-in-clean-space">5.2. Local-MAP optimization: denoise–optimize–re-noise in clean space</h3> <p>The local-MAP paradigm instead views inverse problems as a sequence of <strong>small optimization problems in the clean space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_0\), this yields a clean-space <strong>denoise–optimize–re-noise</strong> operator splitting. The prior trajectory (Steps 1 and 3) depends only on the unconditional diffusion model, while the inner optimization (Step 2) depends only on the measurement model and our choice of local objective and solver.</p> <p>Under this view, seemingly different methods – including DDS, DDRM, DiffusionMBIR, and various PnP/RED-style algorithms – can be unified as instances of the same <strong>local-MAP optimization template</strong> with different choices of surrogate, solver, and re-noising schedule.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Strengths.</strong> Recasts each reverse step as a <strong>standard optimization problem in \(\mathbf{x}_0\)</strong>, allowing us to leverage decades of work on quadratic solvers, Krylov methods, and proximal algorithms. Avoids noisy-space JVPs entirely: all gradients live in clean space or through \(\mathbf{A}\). Naturally targets <strong>MAP-like reconstructions</strong>, which is often exactly what practitioners want in imaging applications.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> The method is only <strong>locally</strong> MAP: it relies on Tweedie anchors and quadratic surrogates remaining faithful to the true posterior landscape in a neighborhood. Solving a local subproblem at every step (e.g. via CG) can be costly for large-scale 3D problems or complex \(\mathbf{A}\). By construction it is mode-seeking, and does not explore the full posterior without additional machinery.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="53-decoupling-as-the-main-design-principle">5.3. Decoupling as the main design principle</h3> <p>Despite these differences, both paradigms share the same structural core:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p><strong>A diffusion prior operator that proposes plausible samples, and a data-consistency operator that enforces the physics.</strong></p> </aside> <p>Posterior-guided methods implement this decoupling directly in noisy space via a posterior score field, while local-MAP methods implement it in clean space via Tweedie anchors and trust-region MAP updates. This decoupling is what makes diffusion priors so attractive for real-world inverse problems: once the prior is trained, we can adapt to new measurement operators and noise models largely by changing <strong>how</strong> we plug in the data-consistency operator, rather than retraining the model.</p> <h3 id="54-limitations-and-outlook">5.4. Limitations and Outlook</h3> <p>Although both paradigms are elegant from theoretically and practically perspective, they rely on approximations (Tweedie denoising, score-to-likelihood projections, local quadratic surrogates). When these approximations break (strongly ill-posed settings, heavy nonlinearity, severe out-of-distribution measurements), performance can degrade in ways that are hard to diagnose. In addition, the computation cost is also a problem that cannot be ignored, posterior-guided methods can be dominated by JVP/gradient cost; local-MAP can be dominated by per-step inner solves—either way, iterative sampling is often the bottleneck.</p> <p>Looking forward, several frontiers remain active in this area:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Hybrid schemes.</strong> Combine global exploration (posterior-guided at high noise) with sharp refinement (local-MAP near \(t\!\to\!0\)).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Beyond linear–Gaussian models.</strong> Most current theory assumes \(\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0 + \mathbf{n}\) with Gaussian noise. Extending these paradigms to non-linear, non-Gaussian, or partially unknown forward models is still challenging.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acceleration and distillation.</strong> Iterative sampling remains expensive. Distillation, consistency models, and related techniques offer promising ways to compress these multi-step procedures into a few learned updates while preserving their geometric structure.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Our hope is that the geometric and probabilistic lens developed in this blog – posterior-guided flows in noisy space, and local-MAP optimization in clean space – can serve as a compact mental model for navigating the rapidly growing literature on diffusion-based inverse problems, and as a design toolkit for building the next generation of robust and reusable inverse solvers.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blogpost develops a geometric and probabilistic lens on diffusion priors for inverse problems.

However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag.

These agents can <em>read</em> the world through managed context pipelines (ingesting documents, code, sensor data) and <em>write</em> to the world via APIs and tools, while continually improving themselves by incorporating new training data (experience) into their weights. As AI systems begin to perform economically valuable tasks across domains <d-cite key="erol2025cost,ide2024artificial,hadfield2025economy,handa2025economic"></d-cite>, from writing <d-cite key="choi-etal-2024-combining"></d-cite> and software development <d-cite key="chen2025textsuperscript,Miserendino2025"></d-cite> to customer service <d-cite key="liu2025evaluating,ackerman2025perceptions"></d-cite> and healthcare <d-cite key="Arora2025,gallifant2025beyond"></d-cite>, there is a pressing need to rigorously measure their performance, value, and risks in terms that organizations can understand and trust.</p> <p>Recent analyses of millions of AI usage instances show that AI is already touching a wide range of occupations, with particularly heavy use in software development and writing tasks (together nearly half of all usage) <d-cite key="Handa2025"></d-cite>. Notably, around 36% of occupations see at least a quarter of their tasks involving AI assistance <d-cite key="Handa2025"></d-cite> – but in most cases this is <em>augmentation</em> (AI helping a human) rather than full automation. Indeed, one study found 57% of AI usage suggests human-AI collaboration (learning or iterating on an output) vs. 43% where the AI essentially completes tasks autonomously <d-cite key="Handa2025"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the capabilities of frontier models have been climbing rapidly. In high-stakes domains like medicine, open-ended physician-written evaluations (HealthBench) show model performance improving from 16% (GPT-3.5) to 32% (GPT-4) and up to 60% with the latest models <d-cite key="Arora2025"></d-cite> within two years – a nearly 4x improvement. In software engineering, new benchmarks of freelance programming tasks (SWE-Lancer) valued at \$1M found that state-of-the-art models can now complete a significant subset of real-world coding jobs (earning about \$400k of the \$1M total value) <d-cite key="Miserendino2025"></d-cite>, though they still fail on the majority of tasks. We are entering what Silver and Sutton term the <em>Era of Experience</em> <d-cite key="SilverSutton2025"></d-cite>, where AI agents learn continuously from real-world interactions rather than solely from static training data.</p> <p><strong>Contributions.</strong> We present an expanded <strong>AI Fundamentals</strong> framework that maps every technical aspect of an AI agent’s performance into the language of economics and public-company finance <d-cite key="bai2025review,garrido2024deep,erol2025cost"></d-cite>. Our goal is to define a single unifying metric – <strong>Agent Economic Value (AEV)</strong> – which collapses all performance aspects into one cash–flow based expression:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \text{AEV} &amp; = \text{Cost Saving} + \text{Efficiency Premium} - \text{Model Cost} \\ &amp;- \text{Data Cost} - \text{Human Intervention Cost}. \end{aligned}\] <ol> <li>We formalise AEV and map each cost or benefit term to GAAP <d-cite key="GAAP"></d-cite> line items, with empirical evidence showing the full expression is measurable today.</li> <li>We provide a measurement methodology validated on software, healthcare, and enterprise usage datasets.</li> <li>We extend the template to the “Era of Experience” where agents learn from grounded, real-world reward streams <d-cite key="SilverSutton2025"></d-cite>.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Data–Asset Valuation.</strong> Interaction logs generated during agent operation accrue as an <em>intangible data asset</em> <d-cite key=" moon-etal-2025-limacost,yanggmvaluator,zhang2025fairshare"></d-cite>. Under GAAP we expense collection and cleaning costs immediately, but we may capitalise the curated corpus once it demonstrably improves future cash flows (analogous to software development costs that pass technological feasibility). The same treatment applies under IFRS (IAS 38), where the asset is amortised over the useful life of the model. We therefore track a “Data R&amp;D” line item that migrates to the balance-sheet once the corpus clears the feasibility gate, providing an auditable bridge from token spend to book value.</p> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <figure style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-economic-agents/economic-value.png" style="width: 40%;"/> <figcaption style="font-size: 1em;">Figure 1: Graphical breakdown of Agent Economic Value (AEV) into positive cash inflows (Cost Saving and Efficiency Premium) versus negative outflows (Model, Data, and Human Intervention Costs).</figcaption> </figure> <h3 id="from-tasks-to-cash-flows">From Tasks to Cash Flows</h3> <p>A <em>task</em> is the atomic unit defined by O<em>NET.

MCP servers provide read/write primitives; GPU clusters host training &amp; inference.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The architecture includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Observer (Read) Paths:</strong> The agent ingests context through managed pipelines (MCP-Read). These could be <em>pull-based</em> queries or <em>push-based</em> streams of information.</li> <li><strong>Actuator (Write) Paths:</strong> The agent produces outputs via actions (MCP-Write), generating text or calling tools/APIs to enact changes in the environment.</li> <li><strong>Agent Core (LLM + Controller):</strong> The large model that processes inputs and decides on outputs, implementing a policy $\pi$ in an RL sense.</li> <li><strong>Learning (Weight Updates):</strong> After tasks are completed, interaction data can be fed back into training pipelines (DL-TRAIN) to update model weights.</li> </ul> <p>Everything is orchestrated by a <strong>Managed Compute &amp; Prompt (MCP) service</strong>, which coordinates reads and writes and provides an interface to the agent.</p> <h3 id="resource-taxonomy-and-marginal-valuation">Resource Taxonomy and Marginal Valuation</h3> <p>Data are <em>non-fungible</em> assets whose worth is governed by their <em>quality</em> rather than sheer volume <d-cite key="moon-etal-2025-limacost,yanggmvaluator,zhang2025fairshare"></d-cite>. We track four economically distinct subclasses:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Expert Time</strong> – manually crafted demonstrations, ratings, or critiques by domain specialists.</li> <li><strong>Live-Environment Experience</strong> – interaction traces collected during real production usage.</li> <li><strong>Inference Data Stream</strong> – prompts and completions logged on-the-fly at inference time.</li> <li><strong>Training Dataset</strong> – the curated corpus used for pre-training or fine-tuning.</li> </ol> <p>The <strong>Model &amp; Compute</strong> layer is priced <em>per inference token</em>. Beyond raw compute, we include a <em>model premium</em>: the price gap between a proprietary frontier model and the best open-source alternative delivering similar quality.</p> <p><strong>Machine Skills</strong> achievable today include coding, deep financial research, and multi-modal artistic generation. Their marginal contribution is reflected in <em>Cost Saving</em> and <em>Efficiency Premium</em>. Conversely, <strong>Human Skills</strong> are either replaced or augmented, with any residual oversight captured by the <em>Human Intervention Cost</em> term.</p> <p>Putting these pieces together, the updated AI Fundamental identity is</p> \[\begin{aligned} \text{AEV} &amp;= \text{Cost Saving} + \text{Efficiency Premium} - \text{Model Cost} \\ &amp;- \text{Data Cost} - \text{Human Intervention Cost}, \end{aligned}\] <p>where Model Cost $=$ (inference compute token cost) $+$ model premium, and all terms are measured on a <em>marginal</em> per-task basis.</p> <h3 id="metric-definitions">Metric Definitions</h3> <p>The above Equation defines AEV with explicit cost fields.</p> \[\begin{aligned} \text{AEV} &amp;= \sum_{i \in T}\!\bigl(\text{CostSaving}_i + \text{EfficiencyPremium}_i\bigr) \\ &amp;- \text{ModelCost}_i - \text{DataCost}_i - \text{HumanInterventionCost}_i. \end{aligned}\] <p>We can also express Agent Economic Value with more detailed cost components:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \text{Agent Economic Value} &amp;= \text{Cost Saving} + \text{Efficiency Premium} \\ &amp;- (C_{\text{GPU}} + C_{\text{energy}} + C_{\text{MCP}} + C_{\text{human}} + C_{\text{data}}) \end{aligned}\] <p>Here, the cost components can be broken down further: $C_{\text{GPU}}$ encompasses expenses for GPUs and other accelerators; $C_{\text{energy}}$ includes power consumption and associated infrastructure like cooling systems; $C_{\text{data}}$ covers the often substantial lifecycle costs of data (acquisition, storage, processing, and ongoing curation), which forms the foundation for the agent’s learning and performance; $C_{\text{MCP}}$ pertains to the managed compute and prompt orchestration services, which can also factor in costs related to algorithmic complexity or specific software; and $C_{\text{human}}$ is the cost of necessary human oversight and intervention.</p> <p><strong>GAAP mapping.</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Cost Saving</strong> $\to$ Operating expense reduction</li> <li><strong>Efficiency Premium</strong> $\to$ Incremental revenue or throughput uplift</li> <li><strong>Model, Data, Human Intervention Costs</strong> $\to$ Cost of goods sold / operating expenses</li> <li><strong>AEV</strong> $\to$ Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT)</li> </ul> <h3 id="efficiency-premium">Efficiency Premium</h3> <p>The Efficiency Premium captures the top-line growth or productivity gain from AI – not just doing the same work for cheaper, but doing <em>more</em> or <em>better</em> with AI than before. This metric recognizes that AI agents can operate at superhuman speed and scale when reliable, potentially generating additional revenue or throughput.</p> <p>Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Customer support AI handling hundreds of chats concurrently compared to a human’s 5 chats</li> <li>Healthcare where AI can engage with patients who otherwise wouldn’t get attention</li> <li>Software development cycles becoming faster, allowing teams to tackle more ambitious projects</li> </ul> <p>The Efficiency Premium often remains latent until human-intervention costs are brought under control. Once the AI is reliable enough (failures are very rare), it can be scaled almost without limit and the premium can accumulate unabated. When intervention costs trend toward zero the negative terms vanish, allowing the Efficiency Premium to accumulate without bound.</p> <h2 id="measurement-methodology">Measurement Methodology</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Task Extraction.</strong> For unstructured chat logs we apply Clio’s embedding+pattern pipeline (DP noise $\epsilon=0.5$) <d-cite key="Handa2025"></d-cite>.</li> <li><strong>Dollar Valuation.</strong> <ul> <li><em>Software</em>: Upwork median payout $\tilde{p}=$ \$500; full ticket pool \$1M <d-cite key="Miserendino2025"></d-cite>.</li> <li><em>Healthcare</em>: average avoided readmission saves \$12,000 (CMS FY-24); multiply HealthBench rubric score by that coefficient <d-cite key="Arora2025"></d-cite>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Human-Intervention Logging.</strong> Tag manual edits, escalations, or tool fallbacks.

As argued by Silver &amp; Sutton, the focus is shifting towards agents that learn from <em>experience</em> by optimizing for grounded rewards directly tied to economic outcomes like profit, or operational metrics like latency <d-cite key="lin2025stop"></d-cite>, rather than relying solely on static human feedback <d-cite key="SilverSutton2025"></d-cite>. The core idea is to define the agent’s objective function in terms of our framework’s value metrics. The total return $G_t$ at a given step $t$ is the sum of immediate economic contributions, $G_t = \text{CostSaving}_t + \text{EfficiencyPremium}_t$. The agent’s learning problem then becomes maximizing the expected cumulative discounted Agent Economic Value over an infinite horizon:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \max_\pi \mathbb{E}\Biggl[ &amp; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k ( (\text{CostSaving}_{t+k} + \text{EfficiencyPremium}_{t+k}) - \\ &amp; \text{ModelCost}_{t+k} - \text{DataCost}_{t+k} - \text{HumanInterventionCost}_{t+k} ) \Biggr]. \end{aligned}\] <p>Here, the agent’s policy $\pi$ is learned to maximize this sum, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor; each term directly reflects measurable economic impact of the agent’s actions.</p> <p>A critical factor for successful RL-driven development is the creation of high-fidelity <em>simulation environments</em>. These environments must closely mirror the specific real-world scenarios in which the agent will operate, including the nuances of tasks, data distributions, and potential failure modes. By interacting with such well-crafted environments (effectively digital twins of operational realities), an agent can rapidly accumulate a vast amount of experience, far exceeding what is feasible with direct real-world interaction alone or from static datasets. For instance, AlphaProof achieved superhuman problem-solving by generating 100 million proofs through interaction with a dedicated proof environment, starting from an initial seed of 100k human proofs <d-cite key="SilverSutton2025"></d-cite>.</p> <p>This RL-driven, experience-based learning paradigm is central to achieving the long-run vision: an agent with consistently high Agent Economic Value. Such an agent continuously expands its capabilities—thereby raising Cost Saving and the Efficiency Premium—while actively learning to keep intervention costs negligible through ongoing adaptation and refinement within its operational or simulated domain. The key is not just the RL algorithms themselves, but the synergy between these algorithms and rich, representative environments that enable effective and accelerated learning.</p> <h2 id="future-outlook-agentic-liquidity-and-the-mcp-wallet">Future Outlook: Agentic Liquidity and The MCP Wallet</h2> <p>The current AEV equation assumes the agent works with fixed resources. However, as agents move toward full autonomy, we must extend the framework to include <strong>Agentic Liquidity</strong>. This is the ability of the agent to hold and spend capital—”MCP form money”—to complete tasks.</p> <h3 id="the-problem-closed-resource-loops">The Problem: Closed Resource Loops</h3> <p>Currently, if an agent lacks a specific tool or data source (e.g., a real-time Bloomberg terminal feed or a paid API for specialized protein folding), it fails or reports to a human.

Being one of the most cited papers in regularized methods for continual learning, this blogpost disentangles the underlying concept of the proposed objective function. We assume that the reader is aware of the basic terminologies of continual learning.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Following are the notations used throughout this blogpost. Vectors and matrices are denoted in bold lowercase and bold uppercase, respectively. Superscript $^{\top}$ denotes matrix transpose. \(\mathbb{E}[\cdot]\) denotes the expectation operator. An optimum value of a variable is denoted by adding a superscript $^{\star}$.</p> <p>Continual learning is a much desired attribute for neural networks. For example, if we train a model to distinguish between images of a cat and a dog (task 1), and subsequently train it again to distinguish between images of chair and table (task 2), the model should be able to retain its knowledge on task 1 even after learning task 2. In simple terms, our network model should be able to perform equally well on all seen tasks, even after learning new ones. Any degradation of performance on the previous tasks after learning new ones is fittingly termed as <em>catastrophic forgetting</em>. This sub-research area has seen an insurgence in works in recent times <d-cite key="kirkpatrick2017overcoming,zenke2017continual,li2017learning,aljundi2018memory"></d-cite>. Briefly, the continual learning scenarios can be categorized into following <d-cite key="van2019three"></d-cite>:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Task-Incremental Learning</strong>: For the given set of tasks, the task identity is known during testing.</li> <li><strong>Domain-Incremental Learning</strong>: For the given set of tasks, task identity is not provided during testing, but need not infer the same.</li> <li><strong>Class-Incremental Learning</strong>: For the given set of tasks, task identity is not provided during testing, but has to infer the same.</li> </ul> <p>We highly recommend <d-cite key="van2019three,wiewel2019localizing"></d-cite> for a good overview of different methodologies to alleviate catastrophic forgetting as well as continual learning in general. The next Section describes the well studied regularization method of continual learning: Elastic Weight Consolidation. It presents a solution to the continual learning problem by making task-specific synaptic (<em>read</em> network parameters) consolidation. Based on the theory of plasticity of post-synaptic dendritic spines in the brain, this method presents a paradigm that marks how important is a network parameter to the previous tasks and penalizes any change made to it depending upon the importance, while learning new tasks.</p> <h2 id="elastic-weight-consolidation">Elastic Weight Consolidation</h2> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="75%" height="auto" title="Possible configurations of θ*_A" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Possible configurations of</strong> $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$.

Training DNNs generates a mapping between the input distribution space and target distribution space. This is done by finding out an optimum \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star\) which results in the least error in the training objective. It has been shown in earlier works <d-cite key="sussmann1992uniqueness"></d-cite> that such a mapping can be obtained with many configurations of $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$, represented in the figure above. The term <em>many configurations</em> can be interpreted as a solution space around the most optimum $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ with acceptable error in the learned mapping. Note that in figures to follow, the shaded ellipses represent the solution of individual tasks where as the overlapping region of multiple ellipses, marked by diagonal lines, represents the common solution space for all tasks.</p> <p>Let’s begin with a simple case of two tasks, task $\mathcal{A}$ and task $\mathcal{B}$. To have a configuration of parameters that performs well for both $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, the network should be able to pick $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ from the overlapping region of the individual solution spaces (see Figure 2). This is with the assumption that there is always an overlapping region for the solution spaces of all tasks for the network to learn them sequentially. A case of four tasks has been illustrated in Figure 2. In the first instance, the network can learn any \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\mathcal{A}}\) that performs well for task $\mathcal{A}$. But with the arrival of task $\mathcal{B}$, the network should pick up a \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}}\).</p> <p>The next question that arrives is how can the network learn the a set of parameters that lies in this overlapping region. To this end, EWC presents a method of selective regularization of parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. After learning $\mathcal{A}$, this regularization method identifies which parameters are important for $\mathcal{A}$, and then penalizes any change made to the network parameters according to their importance while learning $\mathcal{B}$.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="75%" height="auto" title="Overlap of possible configurations of θ*" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Overlap of possible configurations of</strong> $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$.

More specifically given the data $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, we want to learn the posterior probability distribution function $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})$. Following <d-cite key="lherranz2018rotating"></d-cite> and using Bayes rule, we can write</p> <p>\begin{equation} \underbrace{p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})}_{\text{posterior}} = \dfrac{\overbrace{p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})}^{\text{likelihood}}\overbrace{p(\boldsymbol{\theta})}^{\text{prior}}}{p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})} \end{equation}</p> <p>Since maximizing a function is same as maximizing its logarithm, we take \(\log(\cdot)\) of the above equation as follows:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) +\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta})) - \log(p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) \end{equation}</p> <p>To train the neural network on $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, the objective function to be optimized over the log-likelihood function:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \text{argmax}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma}))} \end{equation}</p> <p>For the case of given two independent tasks such that \(\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}\}\) (with $\mathcal{B}$ appearing in sequence after $\mathcal{A}$), the log-posterior can be written as:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) +\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})) - \log(p(\mathcal{B})) \end{equation} where the independence of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is used. Following the Bayesian formulation, $p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the loss for current task $\mathcal{B}$, $p(\mathcal{B})$ is the likelihood for $\mathcal{B}$, and now posterior $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$ for $\mathcal{A}$ becomes prior for $\mathcal{B}$.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Laplace approximation of true posterior pdf" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Laplace approximation of true posterior pdf.</strong> $\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}$ represents the Fisher Information matrix. </div> <p>Referring to the log-posterior equation, it can be observed that we have to deal with the function $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$. This is the posterior function for $\mathcal{A}$ which contains the information about the parameters that explain $\mathcal{A}$ using the given network. As discussed in <d-cite key="kirkpatrick2017overcoming"></d-cite>, this posterior function is said to be intractable. Basically, the intractability of $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$ can be interpreted as the function not existing in some interpretable form. Hence, it is difficult to estimate its quantiles. See <d-cite key="tokdar2013lecture"></d-cite> for an example.</p> <p>Next as the posterior is difficult to analyze in its present form, we aim to approximate it using Laplace approximation. In simple terms, Laplace approximation methodology is employed to find a normal distribution approximation to a continuous probability density distribution (see Figure 3). Assuming $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$ is smooth and majorly peaked around its point of maxima (i.e. $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$), we can approximate it with a normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$ and variance $[\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}]^{-1}$. This brings us to the question on how did we come to the conclusion on these particular values of mean and variance for the normal distribution.</p> <p>To begin with, compute the second order Taylor expansion of $\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ around $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$ as follows:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) +( \dfrac{\partial\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top(\dfrac{\partial^2\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \text{(higher order terms)} \end{equation}</p> <p>Neglecting higher order terms and noting that \(\dfrac{\partial\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}} = 0\) (slope of tangent at peak), we have:</p> \[\begin{align} \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top\underbrace{(\dfrac{\partial^2\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})}_{\text{Hessian}}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) \end{align}\] <p>Using the log-posterior equation, we can write the above for task $\mathcal{A}$ as following:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})) = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}\mid\mathcal{A})) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top(\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \Delta \end{equation}</p> <p>where \(\Delta = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}\mid\mathcal{A}))\). Next, write</p> <p>\begin{equation} (\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}) = -((-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})^{-1})^{-1} \end{equation}</p> <p>and replace it back in the equation to express the same in the standard form of normal distribution function:</p> <p>\begin{equation} p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A}) = \epsilon\exp(-\dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top((-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})^{-1})^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})) \end{equation}</p> <p>where \(\epsilon = \exp(\Delta)\) is a constant. From this equation, it can be concluded that we have obtained the Laplace approximation of posterior pdf as:</p> <p>\begin{equation} p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})\sim\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}, (-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})^{-1}) \end{equation}</p> <p>Notice the variance of the estimated normal distribution of $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$. Given $\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$, the term $\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A}))$ represents the log-likelihood of posterior pdf $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$. Clearly, the term represents the inverse of <strong>Fisher information matrix</strong> (FIM),</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathbb{E}[-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}] \end{equation}\] <p>Note that we obtain $\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}$ by using the Bayesian equation and treating the prior $p(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and $p(\mathcal{A})$ constant. This makes derivative of log of the Bayesian equation posterior and likelihood equal. More on this in <strong>Appendix A.2</strong> of <d-cite key="van2019three"></d-cite>. Finally, we get</p> <p>\begin{equation} p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})\sim\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}, [\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}]^{-1}) \end{equation}</p> <p>Further, as FIM can also be computed from first order derivatives, we can avoid the Hessian computed in the Taylor expansion using the following property <d-cite key="kay1993fundamentals"></d-cite>:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathbb{E}[-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}] = \mathbb{E}[(\dfrac{\partial(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}})(\dfrac{\partial(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}})^\top\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}] \end{equation}\] <p>Now, we can write the log-posterior equation as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) +\dfrac{\lambda}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top(\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \epsilon' \end{equation}\] <p>where $\epsilon’$ accounts for all constants and $\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter introduced to have a trade off between learning $\mathcal{B}$ and not forgetting $\mathcal{A}$. Simplifying more, we have:</p> \[\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) - \dfrac{\lambda}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} - \boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}} (\boldsymbol{\theta} - \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \epsilon' \end{equation}\] <p>This implies: \(\begin{equation} \underbrace{\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}_{\text{overall loss}} = \underbrace{\ell_\mathcal{B}(\boldsymbol{\theta})}_{\text{loss for \mathcal{B} }} - \underbrace{\dfrac{\lambda}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})}_{\text{weight regularizer}} + \epsilon' \end{equation}\)</p> <p>Further simplification can be found in <d-cite key="van2019three"></d-cite>. Before we end this Section, let’s discuss how does the FIM indicates the <strong>importance</strong> of the parameters for the previous tasks.</p> <p>We say a network has learnt a task when its objective has reached a minimum in the loss surface. We know that the curvature of such surfaces represent the sensitivity of the network with respect to the optimum $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$. This sensitivity can be determined by looking at the direction along which $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$ changes. This implies the curvature is inversely proportional to change in $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$. Hence, if the more the curvature, a ‘$\delta$’ increment can result in large increase in the loss. Curvature of a curve is denoted by its Hessian and hence in our case, as the second derivative is of the log likelihood function of the posterior pdf, the FIM \(\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}\) comes into picture. Thus, \(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}\) can tell us which parameter is important to the the previous task as its corresponding element in \(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}\) will have a large value, indicating higher importance.

For example, the case of the Piltdown Man, where researchers selectively (mis-)reported crucial contextual details, misled evolutionary sciences for decades <d-cite key="vincent1999piltdown"></d-cite>. Lack of reporting standards can also lead to confusion, even when everyone acts in good faith. To illustrate, in 19th-century chemistry, the lack of agreed conventions on atomic weights left the field in chaos, with the same compounds appearing under conflicting formulas, until the Karlsruhe Congress established common standards <d-cite key="ihde1961karlsruhe"></d-cite>. These (and other similar) episodes <d-cite key="goldacre2009bad"></d-cite> instill the same lesson: without reliable reporting conventions, even important discoveries can distort rather than advance science.</p> <p>Evaluation - quantitative measurement of a model’s performance on a pre-defined task or benchmark - has long been one of the central means of assessing progress in NLP <d-cite key="jones1994towards, church2017emerging, church2019survey, bowman-dahl-2021-will, kiela-etal-2021-dynabench, sainz-etal-2023-nlp"></d-cite>. Despite this, our standards for reporting evaluations have not kept pace <d-cite key="bhatt2021case, belz-etal-2023-non, belz-etal-2025-standard, zhao-etal-2025-sphere"></d-cite>. Such a lack of standards becomes more concerning with the fast adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) by a wide range of stakeholders, many of whom are not experts and yet heavily depend on such systems to make decisions that impact real-world outcomes <d-cite key="araujo2020ai, bommasani2023holistic"></d-cite>. As LLMs become embedded in critical domains, responsible deployment is a key consideration <d-cite key="10536000, radanliev2024ethics, orr2024building,tripathi2025ethical"></d-cite> and a major part of this includes transparency on what a model can and cannot do. Based on a survey of recent research in the field of evaluation studies, we identify three critical problems stemming from current reporting practices: the <em>Reproducibility Crisis</em>, the <em>Accessibility Crisis</em>, and the <em>Governance Crisis</em>. We discuss why current efforts at transparency <d-cite key="mitchell2019model, gebru2021datasheets"></d-cite> need reconsideration. In light of such issues, we propose EvalCards: concise evaluation summaries which are (i) <em>easy to write</em>, (ii) <em>easy to understand</em>, and (iii) <em>hard to miss</em>. We present case studies of three popular models, showing how difficult it was to gather consistent evaluation details when creating sample EvalCards, and also discuss directions of future work.</p> <p>Our main argument is one for a shift in norms: evaluation reporting is not a marketing exercise but a core component of what it means to release a model responsibly. While the broader challenge of how to evaluate models remains open and complex <d-cite key="laskar2024systematic, chang2024survey, gao2025llm"></d-cite>, our focus here is narrower but nonetheless critical: improving how evaluations are reported. We hope this work sparks conversation and helps move the field toward a culture of more honest and actionable evaluation disclosure practices.</p> <h2 id="problems-with-evaluation-reporting">Problems with Evaluation Reporting</h2> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/eval_card_figure-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/eval_card_figure-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/eval_card_figure-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/eval_card_figure.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>To ground our analysis of problems in evaluation reporting in NLP and AI, we conducted a survey of recent work with systematic keyword searches related to evaluation and reporting (e.g., evaluation, reporting, disclosure, evaluation artifacts) in ACL Anthology, DBLP, and Google Scholar. We complemented this with a reverse snowball sampling from the most recent broad-scope seminal works in NLP evaluation as seeds <d-cite key="weidinger2025toward, gao2025llm,zhao-etal-2025-sphere,chang2024survey,laskar2024systematic,biderman2024lessons,burnell2023rethink, allen2021evaluation"></d-cite>. We then manually analyzed the works to extract recurring themes of discussion. From this, we identify three overarching crises of reproducibility, accessibility, and governance.</p> <h3 id="reproducibility-crisis">Reproducibility Crisis</h3> <p>In machine learning, the broader reproducibility crisis is well discussed <d-cite key="kapoor2023leakage"></d-cite> and also manifests in evaluation reporting <d-cite key="bouthillier2019unreproducible, dodge-etal-2019-show, belz-etal-2025-standard, zhao-etal-2025-sphere"></d-cite>. More specifically, in the context of model evaluations, prior work repeatedly highlights that published results often cannot be trusted without careful reconstruction of undocumented choices <d-cite key="belz-etal-2021-systematic,burnell2023rethink, belz-etal-2023-non, biderman2024lessons, belz-etal-2025-standard, zhao-etal-2025-sphere"></d-cite>. We conduct some case studies on some recent LLM model releases and discuss three such crucial details that are often inconsistent or missing from evaluation details:</p> <p><strong>Target Capability</strong> Model releases include benchmark names and scores, but can often fail to specify what each benchmark is intended to measure. This problem can be exacerbated for reported scores on large composite benchmarks such as SuperGLUE <d-cite key="wang2019superglue"></d-cite> or HELM <d-cite key="bommasani2023holistic"></d-cite> that aggregate tasks across domains and do not provide clarity, especially for non-experts, as to what capability is targeted.</p> <p><strong>Metric</strong> Reported scores frequently omit which evaluation metric was used, which makes it difficult to assess what a score reflects or to compare performance across models fairly <d-cite key="mizrahi2024state, hu2024unveiling"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Prompting Strategy</strong> Prompting, i.e, the way a query is structured and phrased for LLMs, is one of the most significant variables in model performance <d-cite key="hu2024unveiling, sclar2024quantifying, zhuo-etal-2024-prosa, chatterjee-etal-2024-posix"></d-cite>, yet is often absent from reported results. Also, the absence of consistent reporting on a common baseline strategy, such as zero-shot prompting, further hinders meaningful comparison across models <d-cite key="10.1145/3582269.3615599, ousidhoum-etal-2021-probing"></d-cite>.</p> <h3 id="accessibility-crisis">Accessibility Crisis</h3> <p>A recurring theme in relevant work is the highly fragmented nature of available information on models. Documentation frameworks such as Model Cards, DataSheets, and FactSheets were introduced precisely to improve accessibility of information about models <d-cite key="mitchell2019model, gebru2021datasheets, arnold2019factsheets, bhardwaj2024machine, luo2025lack"></d-cite>. However, even today, evaluation details are dispersed across academic papers, technical appendices, GitHub READMEs, HuggingFace model cards, and blog posts, each using different terminology and presentation styles. This scattered documentation makes it difficult to locate and compare the evaluation results. This has consequences for both researchers and users.</p> <p><strong>For Researchers</strong> When evaluation details are scattered across sources, they are easily overlooked or lost altogether. Important context, such as benchmark versions, question framing, or metric details, may never reach the researchers who rely on these results <d-cite key="belz-etal-2023-non,belz-thomson-2024-2024,belz-etal-2025-standard, belz-etal-2025-2025"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>For Users</strong> For non-technical users and decision-makers, the problem is compounded by selective reporting, where only strong benchmark results are emphasized or marketed in some sources, further reducing trust in evaluation claims <d-cite key="arnold2019factsheets"></d-cite>. As a result, users may struggle to select appropriate models, a challenge that becomes particularly critical in high-stakes or sensitive deployment contexts <d-cite key="huijgens2024help, 10.1145/3706598.3713240"></d-cite>.</p> <p>For evaluation to be actionable, it must be consistently visible and easily accessible. Without a standardized way to report evaluations in one place, users are left to piece together incomplete information, undermining efforts to assess a model’s suitability for deployment.</p> <h3 id="governance-crisis">Governance Crisis</h3> <p>AI legislations across the world today, from US to EU <d-cite key="edwards2021eu, act2024eu, sloane2025systematic, carey2025regulating"></d-cite> and from Singapore to China <d-cite key="pande2023navigating, roberts2021chinese, dong2024meta"></d-cite>, are increasingly concerned with transparency <d-cite key="larsson2020transparency, agrawal2024accountability"></d-cite> and reporting mandates <d-cite key="nagendran2020artificial, laux2024three"></d-cite>. Without standardized evaluation reports, governance of models faces three key problems:</p> <p><strong>Risk Assessment</strong> It becomes challenging to determine model risks when the evaluation methods are not clearly reported <d-cite key="hogan2021ethics, novelli2024taking, reuel2024betterbench, reuel2024open"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Algorithmic Accountability</strong> When developers can selectively report results or omit critical weaknesses, it makes it difficult for external reviewers or regulators to hold systems to consistent standards <d-cite key="shah2018algorithmic, wieringa2020account, horneber2023algorithmic"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Compliance Washing</strong> Akin to ethics washing practices <d-cite key="bietti2020ethics"></d-cite>, AI developers can satisfy regulatory requirements by disclosing something—even if that ``something” is incomplete, selectively positive, or methodologically weak <d-cite key="koshiyama2024towards"></d-cite>. Regulatory compliance becomes a box-ticking exercise, undermining the goals of safety, accountability, and public trust <d-cite key="veale2021demystifying"></d-cite>.</p> <p>These crises highlight that the problem is not only how models are evaluated, but how those evaluations are reported. In the next section, we examine limitations of current standardization efforts and introduce EvalCards as a practical solution for improving evaluation reporting.</p> <h2 id="problems-with-existing-standards">Problems with Existing Standards</h2> <p><strong>Lack of evaluation focus</strong> Existing documentation frameworks rarely place evaluation at the center. Model Cards, DataSheets, and FactSheets typically treat evaluation results as only one component among many. BenchmarkCards <d-cite key="sokol2024benchmarkcards"></d-cite> focuses on information specific to a single benchmark only, with no reference to models. For large language models, however, evaluation is the primary means by which users, researchers, and regulators can understand capabilities and limitations.</p> <p><strong>High effort for developers</strong> Most of the proposed documents, like Model Cards <d-cite key="mitchell2019model"></d-cite>, are lengthy and time-consuming to produce since they require additional analysis like listing out all possible use-cases and users, detailed demographic factor evaluation, intersectional quantitative analyses, etc. This can be especially problematic when many models are being released at a rapid pace. Dedicating extra time to such detailed analysis may not be possible.</p> <p><strong>Limited accessibility for non-experts</strong> For decision-makers, policymakers, and many end-users, these documents are often too technical or jargon-heavy to offer real clarity <d-cite key="mcgregor2025err, crisan2022interactive"></d-cite>. For example, OpenAI’s system cards, like the <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/">GPT-4o card</a>, offer in-depth safety and governance information but are often very lengthy and complex. As a result, even when provided, they are underutilized by key stakeholders <d-cite key="blodgett-etal-2024-human"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Lack of visibility</strong> While earlier works have talked about model documentation, not many have emphasized the need for visibility. Today, information about models is frequently buried in supplemental materials, obscure repositories, or separate websites—making it difficult to access and easy to overlook <d-cite key="mcgregor2025err"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="evalcards">EvalCards</h2> <p>To address the challenges outlined in previous sections, we propose Evaluation Disclosure Cards (EvalCards), a short-form standardized reporting format for model evaluations. In this section, we discuss the design principles of an EvalCard, what it should contain, when it should be created, and where it should be available.</p> <h3 id="design-principles-of-evalcards">Design Principles of EvalCards</h3> <p>Any reporting format must go beyond existing documentation efforts by tackling the practical barriers identified above: focusing on evaluation, reducing the burden on developers, making results clear to a wide range of users, and ensuring that evaluation information is consistently visible wherever models are accessed. We summarize the design principles here:</p> <p><strong>Evaluation Focus</strong> Unlike broader documentation frameworks such as Model Cards or DataSheets, which include information about training data, intended use cases, and ethical considerations, EvalCards place evaluation at the center. The goal is not to capture every possible aspect of model development, but to provide clear and standardized details about what was evaluated, how it was evaluated, and under what conditions.</p> <p><strong>Easy to Write</strong> For transparency to become standard practice, evaluation reporting must be easy to implement. EvalCards are designed to capture only the essential details of model evaluation, making them quick to produce and maintain. This is especially important for smaller organizations and open-source model developers that lack the resources to run large test suites.</p> <p><strong>Easy to Understand</strong> Transparency is meaningless if only a handful of experts can interpret it. Evaluation reports must be designed for broad accessibility, enabling not just researchers but also all those without domain expertise to grasp a model’s capabilities and risks quickly.</p> <p><strong>Hard to Miss</strong> As discussed, evaluation details are buried in academic papers, supplementary materials, or hidden deep within repositories. Standardized evaluation reports should be integrated directly into any landing pages where models can be accessed, whether that is on HuggingFace Hub, API dashboards, or third-party model provider repositories. By ensuring that evaluation disclosures are always visible and linked to the model itself, we would create a culture where understanding a model’s capabilities and risks becomes a default part of using models, not an optional deep dive.</p> <h3 id="what-should-an-evalcard-contain">What should an EvalCard contain?</h3> <p><strong>Modalities Evaluated</strong> EvalCards specify which input and output modalities—such as text, image, or audio—the model has been evaluated on.</p> <p><strong>Languages Evaluated</strong> As with modalities, clearly stating which languages a model has evaluated on helps define the scope of its real-world applicability. Many models advertise multilingual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">training'' or</code>support’’, but such claims do not indicate whether those languages have been explicitly tested in any systematic way. Without evaluation, such claims can be misleading <d-cite key="joshi-etal-2020-state, blasi-etal-2022-systematic,talat-etal-2022-reap"></d-cite></p> <p><strong>Capability Evaluation</strong> EvalCards do not prescribe specific benchmarks, but we require developers to explicitly state which core abilities (e.g., summarization, reasoning, factual recall, mathematical problem solving) were evaluated, and to indicate the benchmark chosen for each. Additionally, all reported results should be accompanied by the metric used (e.g., exact match, accuracy, precision@1), zero-shot prompting strategy (to enable better baseline comparison across models), and any alternative prompting strategies tested (e.g., few-shot, chain-of-thought).</p> <p><strong>Safety Evaluation</strong> AI models pose well-documented risks, such as bias <d-cite key="dai2024bias"></d-cite>, toxicity <d-cite key="luong-etal-2024-realistic"></d-cite>, and misinformation generation <d-cite key="zhang2024toward, chen2024combating"></d-cite>. These issues are often under-reported or selectively presented in current evaluation practices <d-cite key="burnell2023rethink, mcgregor2025err"></d-cite>. EvalCards should include a dedicated section for such safety risks. As with capability evaluations, developers should specify the safety feature evaluated, the benchmarks used, the metrics applied, and both the zero-shot and any alternative prompting scores.</p> <p><strong>Developer Footnotes</strong> In this free-text section of the EvalCard, model developers can choose to have relevant footnotes or include any information they think is relevant for users.</p> <h3 id="when-should-evalcards-be-created">When should EvalCards be created?</h3> <p>EvalCards should be generated as part of the initial model release workflow, whether for open-source models or commercial APIs. <em>First,</em> model developers are the ones who trained the model, chose the data, designed the architecture, and tuned the objectives. Standardized evaluation reporting works best when it is done by the people who know the model inside out and at the point of release. Also, most of these evaluations align with internal testing already conducted by developers during model validation phases, and direct reporting can prevent multiple runs of the model on the same tests, leading to reduced climate impact. <em>Second,</em> most models that require evaluation today—especially large foundation models with hundreds of billions of parameters—are built by organizations with substantial compute resources. If a team can train a model with billions of parameters, it is likely to have enough compute to run a standard suite of evaluations.</p> <p>By embedding EvalCard creation into the release pipeline, developers ensure that transparency is delivered upfront, not left to third-party auditors. Furthermore, EvalCards should be updated with each major version change or significant fine-tuning event, reflecting how model behavior may evolve. This keeps users informed of both improvements and potential regressions across the capability and safety dimensions.</p> <h3 id="where-should-evalcards-be-displayed">Where should EvalCards be displayed?</h3> <p>Visibility is a core principle of EvalCards: Evaluation summaries should appear where the model appears. This includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Model Repositories</strong>: EvalCards should be a standard, prominently linked file in Huggingface Hub or Github—similar to a README or license—ensuring that anyone downloading or browsing the model can immediately access it.</li> <li><strong>Commercial Platforms</strong>: For closed-source or hosted models accessed through APIs or user interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini), EvalCards should be integrated into developer dashboards, product documentation, or user-facing pages. This allows users to review evaluation and safety information before deployment or interaction, supporting informed use and regulatory compliance.</li> <li><strong>Research Publications</strong>: For both open and closed-source models, EvalCards should be present as a section in the main text or appendix of academic papers and any technical blogs as a concise summary of evaluation results—providing a clear alternative to selective performance highlights.</li> </ul> <h3 id="model-card-vs-evalcard">Model Card vs EvalCard</h3> <p>Model Cards <d-cite key="mitchell2019model"></d-cite> are an early effort at increasing transparency. However, EvalCards are not designed to serve the same purpose and are complementary to Model Cards. Below, we highlight how EvalCards differ from Model Cards and why they are essential in the current landscape:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Evaluation Focus:</strong> Model Cards were developed at a time when most models were custom-built, and detailed information about training, design motivations, and use cases was essential. EvalCards elevate evaluation to the primary focus and provides a decision-time snapshot to help users and regulators quickly evaluate if a model is appropriate for their needs.</li> <li><strong>Ease of Adoption:</strong> Model Cards focus on open-ended description of model information, including detailed analysis of ethnographic and ethical considerations. However, it can serve as a barrier to adoption by overwhelming end-users with less technical expertise. EvalCards are designed to be lightweight and easy to adopt, with structured fields that capture high-signal evaluation details with minimal overhead.</li> <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Model Cards do not specify where or how they should be displayed, and the information is often buried across multiple sources. EvalCards are displayed where the model is accessed—on model hubs, APIs, or UIs.</li> </ul> <p>As the norm shifts towards the use of off-the-shelf generative AI models, evaluation becomes the key requirement for responsible model deployment.</p> <h2 id="evalcards-case-studies">EvalCards Case Studies</h2> <p>To implement our idea, we started with case studies of three popular LLMs. We document the issues we found for collecting details for each model’s evaluation followed by the creation of an EvalCard for each model. In Fig 1, we create an EvalCard for the model <em>OLMO-2-1124-7B-Instruct</em>, from the OLMo project on transparency and open research from the Allen Institute for AI <d-cite key="olmo20252olmo2furious"></d-cite>- which despite being one of the most open models. Metrics and prompting details were dispersed across sources and inconsistent across benchmarks. Accessibility was limited by scattered results throughout the paper, hindering quick assessment. Safety reporting was aggregated into a single score, offering no dataset-level transparency and preventing meaningful analysis of specific risks.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_olmo-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_olmo-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_olmo-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_olmo.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>In Fig 2, we have an EvalCard for Qwen3-4B-Base, released on the 29th of April 2025. The model’s release lacked timely and transparent evaluation details: key results were delayed, language coverage and capability claims were ambiguous, and many benchmarks lacked metrics or prompting information. Safety evaluations were entirely absent, making it difficult for users to reliably assess the model’s performance or risks.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_qwen-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_qwen-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_qwen-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_qwen.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>In Fig 3, we create an EvalCard for Gemini Flash 2.0 which lacks clear, comprehensive documentation: multilingual support is vaguely described without evidence of evaluated performance, benchmark scores omit metrics and prompting details, and no concrete safety evaluations or red-teaming results are disclosed. As a result, users must rely on incomplete information when assessing the model’s actual capabilities and risks.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_gemini-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_gemini-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_gemini-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_gemini.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>These case studies reveal a common thread: while open-source models like OLMo 2 generally provide more information than their closed counterparts, the process of compiling that information remains time-consuming and often incomplete. EvalCards offer a structured way to consolidate key details in one place, reducing the need to spend hours navigating scattered documentation and supplementary sources. More importantly, EvalCards make it immediately visible what’s missing—turning the absence of evaluation details from something easy to hide into something impossible to ignore. For model providers, EvalCards serve as both a checklist and a commitment: a clear reminder of what transparency actually requires and a visible demonstration of their willingness to provide it.</p> <h2 id="alternative-views">Alternative Views</h2> <p>While we advocate for the adoption of EvalCards, it is important to acknowledge reasonable concerns from different stakeholders. Here, we outline two commonly raised perspectives and address them.</p> <p><strong>A Developer’s View</strong> Developers may argue that evaluation is already done internally, and publishing it publicly increases workload or reputational risk, especially when performance is uneven. However, as regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act and US or UK guidelines begin to demand transparency in model capabilities and risks <d-cite key="act2024eu"></d-cite>, structured evaluation disclosures might become a requirement, not a preference. EvalCards offer a proactive way to meet these expectations. Even seeing what has not been evaluated is useful to avoid misinterpretations and build credibility ahead of external audits or compliance checks <d-cite key="raji2020closing, koshiyama2024towards"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>A Researcher’s View</strong> Researchers may note that evaluation is context-sensitive, where evaluations vary by tasks <d-cite key="chang2024survey"></d-cite> or user groups <d-cite key="hershcovich-etal-2022-challenges"></d-cite> and that standards for ``good’’ benchmarks are still evolving <d-cite key="reuel2024betterbench,liu-etal-2024-ecbd, blodgett-etal-2024-human"></d-cite>. Introducing a fixed reporting format might seem premature. But EvalCards are not rigid templates. They do not enforce benchmark choices but merely require clarity about what was tested and how. This transparency helps everyone interpret results accurately, compare across models, and build on prior evaluations rather than duplicating or misapplying them.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Evaluation reporting is a critical but under-prioritized part of responsible NLP and AI. Non-standardized practices create hurdles for researchers, users, and regulators, fueling reproducibility, accessibility, and governance crises. Existing documentation efforts like Model Cards <d-cite key="mitchell2019model"></d-cite> or BenchmarkCards <d-cite key="sokol2024benchmarkcards"></d-cite> have aimed to improved transparency, but they do not put evaluation at the center. EvalCards aim to close this gap with a format that is easy to write, easy to understand, and hard to miss. By making evaluation details visible and consistent, they turn scattered disclosures into a foundation for cumulative research, informed adoption, and accountability. Looking ahead, we highlight three directions to strengthen and extend the EvalCard framework.</p> <p><strong>Increased Transparency</strong> EvalCards can help establish a unified pipeline that links evaluation and reporting into a single transparent process by reducing ambiguity across sources <d-cite key="biderman2024lessons"></d-cite>. In the longer term, EvalCards could link to Benchmark Cards <d-cite key="sokol2024benchmarkcards"></d-cite> for each mentioned benchmark, creating a connected reporting ecosystem where model, benchmark, and evaluation details are transparently linked to ensure that both the tests and the results behind model claims are easy to trace and verify.</p> <p><strong>Increased Adoption</strong> Widespread adoption will require making EvalCards easy to produce and use. Methods like automated extraction from technical reports <d-cite key="liu-etal-2024-automatic"></d-cite> or community contribution to scores <d-cite key="10855627"></d-cite> can help ease the burden on model developers, while usability testing can help refine design and language for diverse stakeholders <d-cite key="crisan2022interactive"></d-cite>. This will help ensure that EvalCards are not only technically sound but also popular.</p> <p><strong>Regulatory Integration</strong> EvalCards can play a key role in bridging technical evaluation and regulatory transparency. They can serve as a standardized reporting format for models within compliance processes, such as regulatory sandboxes under the EU AI Act <d-cite key="lanamaki2025expect"></d-cite> or US AI Risk Management Framework <d-cite key="ai2023artificial"></d-cite>, by offering a consistent way to report model performance and limitations. Partnerships with platforms like HuggingFace or emerging standards bodies could help maintain vetted benchmark sets that align with evolving priorities. Future work in technical governance <d-cite key="reuel2024open, reuel2024position"></d-cite> can explore how EvalCards can be incorporated into regulatory compliance workflows, e.g., by establishing minimum mandatory fields tied to emerging AI regulations.</p> <p>As model development accelerates, reporting practices must evolve with equal urgency. Evaluation should drive progress, not confusion—but that is only possible when what models can and cannot do is made clear. EvalCards take a small but concrete step toward that goal, embedding transparency into the model release process itself. We hope this work sparks deeper reflection and concrete action toward standardizing how we evaluate and report on models.</p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the age of rapidly released LLMs, evaluation reporting is fragmented, inconsistent, and often misleading.

Background and Motivation</h2> <p>The landscape of continuous-time generative modeling has largely crystallized into three dominant lineages, each defining a specific relationship between a complex data distribution and a simple prior.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Score-based Diffusion (SDEs) <d-cite key="song2019generative,song2020score"></d-cite>:</strong> Models learn the score function $\nabla_x \log p_t(x)$ to reverse a stochastic diffusion process. Sampling requires simulating a reverse-time SDE or its deterministic probability-flow ODE:</p> \[\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, t) - \frac{g^2(t)}{2}\,s_{\theta}(x_t, t).\] </li> <li> <p><strong>Flow Matching (CNFs) / Rectified flow <d-cite key="lipman2022flow,liu2022flow"></d-cite>:</strong> Instead of deriving dynamics from a forward diffusion, Flow Matching directly regresses a velocity field $v_\theta(x,t)$ that pushes a Gaussian source probability path toward the data target:</p> \[\frac{dx}{dt} = v_\theta(x,t).\] </li> <li> <p><strong>Consistency Models (CMs) <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>:</strong> Aiming for speed, CMs attempt to bypass integration entirely by learning a map $f_\theta$ that projects any point on a trajectory directly to its origin ($t=0$):</p> \[f_\theta(x_t,t) \approx x_0 \implies f_\theta(x_t,t) = f_\theta(x_{t'}, t').\] </li> </ul> <p>While these methods have achieved remarkable success, they face a dichotomy between <strong>flexibility</strong> and <strong>efficiency</strong>.</p> <p>Integration-based methods (Diffusion, Flow Matching) are flexible but computationally expensive, requiring dozens or hundreds of sequential function evaluations (NFEs) to traverse the trajectory. Conversely, distillation methods like Consistency Models are fast (1-2 steps) but structurally <strong>rigid</strong>: they typically memorize the mapping to a fixed endpoint ($s=0$). This “schedule lock-in” makes them brittle under guidance, editing, or varying step counts, as the model lacks knowledge of the intermediate geometry of the flow.</p> <p>To achieve <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>few-step</strong>, and <strong>highly controlled</strong> generation, we need a primitive that is richer than a single-point mapping but faster than numerical integration.</p> <h2 id="2-the-flow-map-paradigm">2. The Flow Map Paradigm</h2> <p>Sampling from modern generative models is traditionally viewed as “following a trajectory”: starting from noise and iteratively integrating a velocity field. We propose a shift in perspective: what if the fundamental object of learning is not the infinitesimal velocity, but the <strong>finite-time transformation</strong> itself?</p> <p>We define the <strong>Flow Map</strong> as the family of two-time solution operators $\Phi_{t\to s}$ that answers the question:</p> <div class="box-note"> <p><strong>The Operator Question:</strong> If the system is currently at state $x_t$ at time $t$, exactly where will it be at time $s$?</p> </div> <h3 id="21-from-trajectories-to-operators">2.1. From trajectories to operators</h3> <p>Consider a time-dependent vector field $v_{\phi}(x, t)$ defining the ODE: \(dx/dt = v_{\phi}(x, t)\). While the vector field describes <strong>local</strong> motion, the flow map \(\Phi_{t\to s}: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) describes the <strong>global</strong> transport. It is characterized by the integral equation:</p> \[x_s = \Phi_{t\to s}(x_t) \triangleq x_t + \int_{t}^{s} v_{\phi}(x_{\tau},\tau) d\tau, \qquad 0 \le s \le t \le 1.\tag{2.1}\label{eq:21}\] <p>The <strong>Flow Map Paradigm</strong> reframes generative modeling from an <strong>integration problem</strong> to a <strong>function approximation problem</strong>. Instead of solving the integral at inference time, we train a neural network $f_\theta(x_t, t, s)$ to approximate the operator directly:</p> \[f_\theta(x_t, t, s) \approx \Phi_{t\to s}(x_t).\] <p>A mathematically valid flow map must satisfy two intrinsic algebraic properties, which serve as the “physics” of the operator:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Identity:</strong> $\Phi_{t\to t}(x) = x$.</li> <li> <p><strong>Semigroup (Composition) Property:</strong> For any intermediate time $u$,</p> \[\Phi_{u\to s} \circ \Phi_{t\to u} = \Phi_{t\to s}.\] </li> </ol> <h3 id="22-unifying-existing-methods">2.2. Unifying Existing Methods</h3> <p>The Flow Map formulation provides a generalized coordinate system for understanding recent acceleration techniques. As illustrated in Figure 1, we can interpret existing models as restricting the flow map $f_\theta(x, t, s)$ to specific subsets of the time domain $(t, s)$.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-flow-map-learning/flow_map_vs_four_paradigms_clean-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-flow-map-learning/flow_map_vs_four_paradigms_clean-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-flow-map-learning/flow_map_vs_four_paradigms_clean-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-flow-map-learning/flow_map_vs_four_paradigms_clean.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Figure 1. Flow maps as a unifying operator view.</figcaption> </figure> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Consistency Models (CM) are Boundary Operators:</strong> CMs restrict the target time to the data manifold ($s=0$). They learn the slice:</p> \[f_\theta^{\text{CM}}(x_t, t) \equiv f_\theta(x_t, t, 0).\] <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Because they ignore $s &gt; 0$, they cannot support iterative refinement or arbitrary start-stop editing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flow Matching (FM) is the Infinitesimal Limit:</strong> FM learns the velocity field $v_\phi$, which is the derivative of the flow map as $s \to t$:</p> \[v_\phi(x,t) = \lim_{s\to t} \frac{f_\theta(x, t, s) - x}{s-t}.\] <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Recovering finite jumps requires expensive numerical integration.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>MeanFlow is a Linearized Operator:</strong> MeanFlow <d-cite key="geng2025mean"></d-cite> parameterizes the map using an average velocity $u_\theta$:</p> \[f_\theta(x, t, s) = x + (s-t)u_\theta(x, t, s).\] <p>where</p> \[u_{\theta}(x_t,t,s) \approx \frac{1}{s-t}\,\int_{t}^{s} v_\theta(x_\tau,\tau)\,d\tau.\] <p>This enforces a linear inductive bias on the trajectory between $t$ and $s$.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Consistency Trajectory Models (CTM) are Discrete Compositions:</strong> CTM <d-cite key="kim2023consistency"></d-cite> enforces the composition property on a discrete grid of time steps, acting as a discretized surrogate of the full flow map algebra:</p> \[f_\theta(f_\theta(x, t_2, t_1), t_1, t_0) \approx f_\theta(x, t_2, t_0).\] </li> </ul> <h3 id="23-why-operators-speed-control-and-composability">2.3. Why Operators? Speed, Control, and Composability</h3> <p>By lifting the abstraction from <strong>trajectories</strong> to <strong>operators</strong>, we gain distinct advantages:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Amortization of Integration (Speed):</strong> We trade the cost of repeated integration during training for $O(1)$ inference. A jump from $t=1$ to $t=0$ becomes a single function call, yet unlike Consistency Models, we retain the ability to stop at any $s$.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Decoupling Physics from Discretization (Control):</strong> Trajectory-based samplers entangle the ODE dynamics with the solver’s step size. With a flow map, the “desired jump” $(t, s)$ is an explicit input. This makes the model robust to changing step counts and enables non-uniform schedules tailored to specific editing tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Algebraic Consistency:</strong> Complex pipelines (e.g., SDEdit, in-painting) often require jumping back and forth in time. A flow map trained with composition constraints ensures that $x_t \to x_s \to x_u$ yields a valid state, preventing the accumulation of drift errors common in heuristic distillations.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="3-training-two-time-operators-via-eulerian-and-lagrangian-distillation">3. Training Two-Time Operators via Eulerian and Lagrangian Distillation</h2> <p>We have defined the object of interest: a neural operator $f_\theta(x_t, t, s)$ approximating the true solution $\Phi_{t\to s}$ of a teacher velocity field $v_\phi$. The challenge is training this operator efficiently without running expensive ODE solvers in the loop.</p> <p>We can derive training objectives by analyzing the partial derivatives of the flow map $\Phi_{t\to s}$ with respect to its two time arguments. These lead to two complementary “distillation” paradigms.</p> <h3 id="31-the-lagrangian-view-moving-the-endpoint">3.1. The Lagrangian View: Moving the Endpoint</h3> <p>Fix the start state $x_t$ at time $t$. As we vary the target time $s$, the output $x_s$ traces a trajectory of the teacher ODE. This is the <strong>Lagrangian</strong> perspective (following the particle).</p> <p><strong>The Identity <d-cite key="boffi2025flow"></d-cite>:</strong> Differentiation w.r.t. $s$ yields:</p> \[\boxed{\ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \Phi_{t\to s}(x_t) = v_\phi(\Phi_{t\to s}(x_t), s) \ }\] <p><strong>Intuition:</strong> As the target time $s$ advances, the value of the map changes according to the teacher’s velocity at the current location.</p> <p><strong>Lagrangian Distillation (LMD) <d-cite key="sabour2025align"></d-cite>:</strong> Directly matching this derivative gives us a training objective. In practice, we use a robust “predict-then-correct” discretization. We predict a jump to an intermediate time $s’$, and then ensure that taking one Euler step from $s’$ leads to the same result as predicting $s$ directly.</p> <p>Let $s’ = s + \varepsilon (t-s)$. A discrete loss is:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LMD}} = \mathbb{E}_{t,s} \left[ \left\| f_\theta(x_t, t, s) - \underbrace{\left( f_{\theta^-}(x_t, t, s') + (s-s') v_\phi(f_{\theta^-}(x_t, t, s'), s') \right)}_{\text{1-step Teacher correction}} \right\|^2 \right].\] <p>Here, $f_{\theta^-}$ is a target network (EMA). This effectively trains the student to match the teacher’s <em>future</em> velocity.</p> <h3 id="32-the-eulerian-view-moving-the-start">3.2. The Eulerian View: Moving the Start</h3> <p>Alternatively, fix the target time $s$ and the spatial coordinate $x$, but vary the start time $t$. This describes how the solution operator itself evolves and leads to the <strong>Eulerian</strong> perspective (observing the flow at a fixed point).</p> <p><strong>The Identity <d-cite key="boffi2025flow"></d-cite>:</strong> The composition law implies a transport PDE (the Kolmogorov Backward Equation):</p> \[\boxed{\ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Phi_{t\to s}(x) + J_x \Phi_{t\to s}(x) \, v_\phi(x, t) = 0 \ }\] <p><strong>Intuition:</strong> If we perturb the start time $t$ (move it slightly toward $s$), we must compensate by moving the input $x$ along the flow $v_\phi$ by that same amount, such that the final destination $s$ remains unchanged.</p> <p><strong>Eulerian Distillation (EMD) <d-cite key="sabour2025align"></d-cite>:</strong> This identity enforces <strong>consistency under transport</strong>. A discrete approximation involves taking a small teacher step from $t$ to $t’$ and demanding that the flow map from $t’$ yields the same result.</p> <p>Let $t’ = t + \varepsilon (s-t)$. We first compute $x_{t’} = x_t + (t’-t)v_\phi(x_t, t)$. The loss is:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{EMD}} = \mathbb{E}_{t,s} \left[ \left\| f_\theta(x_t, t, s) - f_{\theta^-}(x_{t'}, t', s) \right\|^2 \right].\] <p>This is the core mechanism behind Consistency Models, but generalized here for arbitrary target times $s$.</p> <h3 id="33-synthesis-a-unified-objective">3.3. Synthesis: A Unified Objective</h3> <p>The Lagrangian and Eulerian views provide orthogonal supervision signals:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lagrangian (LMD)</strong> stabilizes the <strong>destination</strong>: it ensures the map outputs valid states along the ODE trajectory.</li> <li><strong>Eulerian (EMD)</strong> stabilizes the <strong>path</strong>: it ensures the map is invariant to the choice of starting time along the flow.</li> </ul> <p>Combining these allows for training flow maps that are both locally accurate (matching the vector field) and globally consistent (respecting composition). By learning the full operator $\Phi_{t\to s}$, we obtain a generative model that offers the speed of distilled models without sacrificing the flexibility of differential equations.</p> <h2 id="4-experiments">4. Experiments</h2> <p>In the previous sections, we proposed a shift from <strong>trajectory integration</strong> (solving an SDE/ODE step-by-step) to <strong>operator learning</strong> (predicting the jump $\Phi_{t\to s}$ directly). This theoretical reframing leads to two verifiable hypotheses regarding the behavior of generative models:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Robustness to Discretization:</strong> If a model learns the finite-time operator directly, its generation quality should be decoupled from the inference step count (NFEs), unlike solvers that rely on infinitesimal approximations.</li> <li><strong>Algebraic Consistency (Semigroup Property):</strong> a genuine flow map should approximately satisfy the semigroup law \(\Phi_{u\to s} \circ \Phi_{t\to u} \approx \Phi_{t\to s}\), so chaining multiple jumps should induce <strong>small drift</strong> compared to a direct jump.</li> </ol> <p>To validate these claims without repeating ourselves, we use <strong>two experiments under a shared inpainting setup</strong>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Exp-I (Step sensitivity, Sec 4.3) :</strong> Compare integration-based samplers (SDE/ODE) vs jump-distilled samplers (CM-like / Flow-like) under different NFEs. This answers <strong>why jumps help at low steps.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Exp-II (Composition drift, Sec 4.4) :</strong> Compare <strong>direct</strong> \(\Phi_{t\to s}\) vs <strong>composed</strong> \(\Phi_{u_{k-1}\to s}\circ\cdots\circ\Phi_{t\to u_1}\) for different hop counts $k$. This answers <strong>why two-time operators are more stable than endpoint-anchored jumps in multi-hop pipelines.</strong></p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="41-shared-experimental-setup-common-to-both-experiments">4.1. Shared experimental setup (common to both experiments)</h3> <p><strong>Task: image inpainting.</strong> Given an image \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{H\times W}\) and a binary mask \(m\in\{0,1\}^{H\times W}\), the goal is to fill the masked region $\Omega$ (where \(\Omega=\{(i,j) \mid m_{ij}=1\}\)) in a way consistent with the context and text prompt.

A note on “proxies”: what we <em>did</em> and <em>did not</em> implement</h3> <p>A key practical detail is that we do <strong>not</strong> train a full flow-map network \(f_\theta(x_t,t,s)\) from scratch in this blog post. Instead, we use <strong>public distilled LoRAs <d-cite key="hu2022lora"></d-cite></strong> as <strong>stand-ins</strong> for two different structural paradigms:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>LCM-LoRA as an endpoint-jump proxy (CM-like):</strong> it behaves like a boundary map \(B_t(x_t)\approx x_0\), and any \(t\to s\) jump is synthesized via “denoise to $x_0$, then re-noise to $s$”.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>TCD-LoRA as a two-time-jump proxy (Flow-like):</strong> we treat the model as supporting a DDIM-coupled jump \(a\to b\) that depends on the target time through \((\alpha_b,\sigma_b)\), rather than always anchoring at \(t=0\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Concretely, in Exp-II we instantiate two “operators”:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Flow-proxy jump (DDIM-coupled):</strong></p> \[\Phi^{\text{flow}}_{a\to b}(x_a) = \frac{\alpha_b}{\alpha_a} x_a + \Bigl(\sigma_b-\frac{\alpha_b}{\alpha_a}\sigma_a\Bigr)\,\varepsilon_\theta(x_a,a),\] <p>where \(\varepsilon_\theta\) comes from the TCD-distilled predictor and \((\alpha_t,\sigma_t)\) are from a reference DDIM schedule.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>CM-proxy jump (endpoint-anchored):</strong></p> \[\Phi^{\text{CM}}_{a\to b}(x_a) = \alpha_b\,B_a(x_a) + \sigma_b\,\epsilon_0,\] <p>where \(B_a(x_a)\) is a learned endpoint map: \(x_a \to x_0\), comes with a fixed \(\epsilon_0\) shared across all compositions.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Why this is still meaningful.</strong> Our goal is <strong>not</strong> to claim “we trained the definitive flow map.” The goal is to empirically test a <em>structural hypothesis</em> from Chapters 2–3: <strong>multi-hop pipelines should be more stable when the underlying primitive is a genuine two-time operator (semigroup-consistent), and less stable when every hop must “return to \(x_0\)” as an anchor.</strong></p> <p>Even with proxies, Exp-II directly measures the <strong>semigroup violation diagnostic</strong> (direct vs composed). As long as the two proxies reflect the two paradigms (endpoint-anchored vs time-to-time jump), the diagnostic remains aligned with the theory.</p> <p><strong>Limitation (explicit):</strong> the absolute numerical values of drift depend on the particular checkpoints; a true \(f_\theta(x_t,t,s)\) trained with explicit composition constraints could reduce drift further. We view the proxy study as an <strong>evidence-of-principle</strong> validation.</p> <h3 id="43-exp-i-inpainting-under-different-nfes-robustness-to-discretization">4.3. Exp-I: Inpainting under different NFEs (Robustness to Discretization)</h3> <p>We first test whether jump-based inference indeed reduces step sensitivity.

Conclusion</h2> <p>This post advocated a simple shift in abstraction: <strong>from integrating trajectories to learning operators</strong>. Instead of treating sampling as the repeated numerical solution of an ODE/SDE, we view generation as composing <strong>finite-time maps</strong>. The flow map family \(\{\Phi_{t\to s}\}\) is the minimal object that retains <em>control</em> (arbitrary start/stop times) while enabling <em>speed</em> (amortized jumps), and its algebraic structure—<strong>identity</strong> and the <strong>semigroup law</strong>—acts as the “physics” that distinguishes a genuine two-time operator from a boundary-only shortcut.</p> <p>We then showed how this operator view organizes a large body of recent work:</p> <ul> <li>Consistency Models emerge as <strong>boundary operators</strong> \(f_\theta(x_t,t,0)\), fast but structurally rigid.</li> <li>Flow Matching is the <strong>infinitesimal limit</strong> of a flow map, flexible but expensive at inference.</li> <li>MeanFlow and CTM can be interpreted as intermediate points that impose linearization or discrete composition constraints.</li> </ul> <p>On the training side, we derived two complementary distillation perspectives:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>Lagrangian view (LMD)</strong> supervises <strong>how the endpoint moves</strong> with the target time $s$, anchoring the operator to the teacher’s dynamics.</li> <li>The <strong>Eulerian view (EMD)</strong> supervises <strong>how the operator evolves</strong> with the start time $t$, enforcing invariance under transport and connecting naturally to consistency-style objectives.</li> </ul> <p>Together, they suggest that “learning \(\Phi_{t\to s}\)” is not a single recipe but a <strong>design space</strong>: which derivatives you match (and how strongly you enforce composition) determines how well the learned operator behaves under chaining and editing.</p> <p>Finally, we proposed two concrete, falsifiable hypotheses for operator learning and tested them under a shared inpainting setup:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Robustness to discretization:</strong> jump-based inference should be less sensitive to the step budget than integration-based sampling.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Algebraic consistency:</strong> if an operator is semigroup-consistent, <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>composed</strong> jumps should agree, and the discrepancy should grow slowly with hop count.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Even with practical proxies (LCM as endpoint-anchored, TCD as DDIM-coupled two-time jump), the experiments support the central narrative: <strong>operator-like jumps are step-robust, and two-time jumps exhibit substantially lower compositional drift than endpoint-anchored hops</strong>. This points to a useful takeaway beyond any specific method: <strong>“semigroup violation” can serve as a unit test for generative operators</strong>, especially in pipelines that repeatedly jump across time (editing, multi-stage refinement, or back-and-forth schedules).</p> <h3 id="limitations-and-outlook">Limitations and Outlook</h3> <p>Our study deliberately prioritized <em>structure</em> over <em>full-scale training</em>: we did not train a complete \(f_\theta(x_t,t,s)\) with explicit semigroup regularization. The next step is therefore clear: train true flow maps with (i) broad coverage over $(t,s)$, (ii) explicit composition constraints, and (iii) evaluation on tasks where chaining is unavoidable (e.g., iterative editing loops, guided refinement schedules, and long-horizon compositions). If successful, operator learning could offer a principled route to <strong>fast</strong> generation that remains <strong>composable</strong>, <strong>controllable</strong>, and <strong>stable under changing schedules</strong>—precisely where many endpoint-anchored distillations tend to break.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post, we reframe continuous-time generative modeling from integrating trajectories to learning two-time operators (flow maps).
