They work by learning to reverse a gradual noising process. In a <strong>Forward Pass</strong> the data modality is progressively corrupted with gaussian noise until it becomes complete noise. In the <strong>Reverse process</strong> the model learns a denoiser which start from a gaussian noise and denoise this step-by-step to get an apprxomately clean sample. While this framework has proven to be quite effective, the existing works treats the noise as spatially uniform gaussian noise \(\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)\).</p> <p>The modalities mentioned above have one thing in common. They exibits <strong>power law</strong> in their Fouries representation. That is, the low-frequency components have orders of magnitude higher variance than high-frequency components <d-cite key="vanHateren1992"></d-cite>. To interpret the fourier component through visual representation, we can say low frequencies capture the global structure while the high frequency encodes the finer details. On viewing diffusion though the fouries lens of the data, it has an important implications: The DDPM forward process noises high-frequency components substantially earlier and faster as compared to the low frequency components. This can be attributed to the fact that Gaussian noise is applied irrespective of the data’s spectral content as we show later.</p> <p>Since the introduced Gaussian noise is agnostic to the data’s spectral characteristics, the forward process thereby imposes a hierarchy of frequencies during generation. As the higher frequencies are noised earler and faster in the forward process, and DDPM learns to reverse this forward process: during backward process the higher frequencies are generated later conditioned on the forward process as we see in Figure 3. Previous works has also observed this phenomenon of imposed hierarchy of frequencies during generation<d-cite key="falck2025fourierspaceperspectivediffusion"></d-cite></p> <p>Images aren’t spectrally flat. Natural images concentrate most of their power in lower frequencies following characteristic power-law distributions, while images from domains like Astronomy, Texture Design have varied concentration of pwer across the frequency bands. This raises a fundamental question: if datasets have inherent frequency biases and the denoising trajectory naturally progresses from coarse-to-fine structure, why do we apply the same uniform white noise at every timestep and across all frequencies? How does this same uniform white noise across all frequencies perform across images form varied domain? Our research asks whether we can explicitly shape the noise spectrum to (i) match each dataset’s actual frequency distribution and (ii) implement a principled time-frequency annealing schedule—shifting from low to high frequencies as denoising progresses—to improve sample quality and training stability without modifying the underlying UNet architecture or DDPM objective.</p> <h2 id="quick-overview">Quick Overview</h2> <p>Let’s start with a quick overview of the two frameworks we will be working with: Diffusion models and Frequency domain of Images.</p> <h3 id="diffusion-models">Diffusion Models</h3> <p>Diffusion models generate data by learning to reverse a gradual noising process. The core idea is elegantly simple: start with real data and progressively corrupt it by adding Gaussian noise over many steps until it becomes pure random noise. This forward process requires no learning and follows a predefined schedule. A neural network then learns to invert this process, starting from random noise and iteratively denoising it to recover clean, structured data. This reverse process is governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that describe how probability distributions evolve over time, with the model learning to approximate the score function which guides the denoising steps.</p> <h3 id="forward-process">Forward Process</h3> <p>It defines a markov chain that progressively add gaussian noise to the data sample \(\mathbf{x}_0 \sim q(\mathbf{x}_0)\) over \(T\) timesteps. Each timestep adds a slight noise to the data resulting in a increasingly noisy samples \(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_T\), where $\mathbf{x}_T$ approximates an isotropic Gaussian distribution. The forward process is formally defined as :</p> \[q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} \, \mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I}),\] <p>where $\beta_t \in (0,1)$ controls the amount of noise added to the data.</p> <p>By applying the reparameterization reccursively we obtain the closed form experssion</p> \[q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_0) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \, \mathbf{x}_0, (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t)\mathbf{I}),\] <p>where \(\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t\) and \(\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^t \alpha_s\).</p> <p>Thus the noisy data at any given time \(t\) in the forward proccess</p> \[\mathbf{x}_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\mathbf{x}_0 + \sqrt{(1 - \bar{\alpha}_t)}\epsilon\] <p>where \(\epsilon \in \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})\).</p> <p>A useful notation in this is the log signal-to-noise ratio \(\lambda_t = log(\bar{\alpha}_t / (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t))\) which increases monotonically from 0 ( clean data) to 1 (noise)</p> <h3 id="reverse-process">Reverse Process</h3> <p>The Reverse process tries to invert the forward process, transforming Gaussian noise \(\mathbf{x}_T \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})\) back into a data sample resembling the data distribution \(q(\mathbf{x}_0)\). Since the true reverse transitions \(q(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t)\) are intractable, a parameterized model \(p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t)\) is trained to approximate them.</p> <p>The reverse process is modeled as:</p> \[p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t)),\] <p>where \(\boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta\) and \(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta\) are outputs of a neural network conditioned on \(\mathbf{x}_t\) and the timestep \(t\). The model learns to predict the mean of the denoised sample at each step.</p> <p>Using the forward process derivation, the true mean of \(q(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_0)\) can be expressed as:</p> \[\boldsymbol{\mu}_q(\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( \mathbf{x}_t - \frac{\beta_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \right),\] <p>where \(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\) denotes the Gaussian noise added at timestep \(t\).</p> <p>On way of learning is during training the model is optimized to predict this noise directly using a loss of the form:</p> \[L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{x}_0, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}} \left[ \left\| \boldsymbol{\epsilon} - \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_\theta( \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\mathbf{x}_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}, t ) \right\|^2 \right],\] <p>which corresponds to a reweighted variational bound on the data likelihood.</p> <h3 id="fouries-domain">Fouries Domain</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/image_fft-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/image_fft-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/image_fft-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/image_fft.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/power_law-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/power_law-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/power_law-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/power_law.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure2: First two image shows an image in spatial, in frequency domain. The plot is the log-log plot of Power spectral density and Frequency of the image. </div> <p>Natural Images have rich structures in the frequency domain that is obscured in the pixel space. Understanding this frequency domain perspective is crucial for our investigation.</p> <p>Let’s say we have an image \(x \in \mathbf{R}_{H \times W\times C}\). Its pixels are coeffcient of a standard basis \(\mathcal{B} = \{ \mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \dots, \mathbf{e}_n \} \subset \mathbb{R}^n\). In the spatial domain, the image is defined as a linear combination of standard basis vectors, where each pixel represents a local real-valued intensity. When we apply the Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) to this image, it performs unitary change of basis giving us the frequency domain equivalent of the image. The dimension of the fourier and the pixel image remains the same but in fourier domain the coefficients of the basis becomes complex valued.</p> <p>For each channel of an image the DFT can be formulated as</p> \[F(u, v) = \sum_{x=0}^{H-1} \sum_{y=0}^{W-1} f(x, y) e^{-j 2\pi \left( \frac{ux}{H} + \frac{vy}{W} \right)}\] <p>where \((u,v)\) aer spatial frequency indices. The radial frequency \(f = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}\) measure the distance from the DC ( zero frequency component)</p> <p>Now, let’s sort the Fourier coeeficient \(f(u,v)\) from low to high frequency. To do so, we start from the center of our Fourier Space and walk in spirals. That is, sort them using the Manhatten distancen of the indices \((uv,)\) from the center (0,0) of the Fourier representation. From the Figure 2 It’s very evident that signal variance decreases rapidly with increasing frquency. <d-cite key="dielman"></d-cite> shows that similar trend is visible in other doains (Videos, Audio, Proteins) as well.</p> <p><strong>Power Spectral Density(PSD)</strong>: This quantifies how the signal enery is distributed across frequencies. For an image with Fourier Transform \(F(u,v)\), PSD is defined as :</p> \[P(u,v) = |F(u,v)|^2\] <p>representing the power at each frequency component. To get one dimensional spectral profile we compute the radially-average PSD by integrating over annular regions at constant radial frequency \(f\) (simply put we compute average power in ring-shaped zones moving outward from the center). Formally put</p> \[P(f) = \frac{1}{|B_f|} \sum{}_{(u,v) \in B_f} |F(u,v)|^2\] <p>Where \(B_f\) is the radial frequency band defined as \(B_f = {(u,v): f \leq \sqrt{u^2+v^2} \le f+ \delta f}\) and \(\|B_f\|\) is the number of frequencies in that band.</p> <p>The PSD reveals how much each frequency contributes to the overall signal. For a dataset of images, we compute per-image PSDs and average them to obtain a dataset-level spectral profile. This aggregate PSD characterizes the typical frequency distribution of the data and captures domain-specific properties</p> <p>Real-world image datasets exhibit characteristic frequency distributions. The power spectral density of natural images typically follows a power-law decay:</p> \[P \propto f^{-\alpha}\] <p>Emperical studies on natural image statistics shave shown that \(\alpha\) typically resides in the interval \([1,3]\) <d-cite key="field,physrevLett"> </d-cite>.

This is acomplished by applying the Fourier transform \(\mathbf{F}\) to the variable \(x_t\)</p> \[y_t : \mathbf{F}\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{F}\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\mathbf{x}_0 + \mathbf{F}\sqrt{(1 - \bar{\alpha}_t)}\epsilon\] <p>Here, \(y_t\) is our fourier-transformed intermediate step at time step \(t\) of the forward process.</p> <p>Taking the quantification of Signal-to-noise Ration from <d-cite key="falck2025fourierspaceperspectivediffusion"></d-cite>, where SNR of \((x_t)_i\) is the signal to noise ration of frquescy \(i\) at timestep \(t\). Formally put</p> \[SNR((x_t)_i) = \frac{\bar{\alpha_t}\varsigma_i}{1-\bar{\alpha_t}}\] <p>Where \(\varsigma_i = Var((x_0)_i)\) represents the signal variance of requency \(i\).</p> <p>Tying these all together, we see in Figure 3, that standard DDPM corrupts high-frequencies faster than low frequencies. This bias is carry forwarded to the reverse process as well.</p> <p>Thus we want to study an alternate noising schedule that respects the datasets spectral signature. To put simply a Frequency Adaptive Noise Scheduler ( FANS ).</p> <h2 id="fans">FANS</h2> <p>In the previous sections we saw the inductive bias of DDPM towards high frequency components both in forward and reverse process. We want to investigate if instead of isotropic gaussian noise scheduler (irrespective of the frequency distribution of the dataset), we use a scheduler that is adaptive to the intrinsic frequency characteristic of the dataset by constructing spectrally-shaped noise. Our key insight is that different frequency bands contribute unequally to perceptual quality and should be treated accordingly during both training and generation.</p> <p>This proposed approach, operates through three complementary mechanism :</p> <ol> <li><strong>Dataset importance profiling</strong>: We analyze the spectraal distribution of the data to compute frequency band importance weight \(g_b\) that quantifies the relative contribution of each band of the overall data.</li> <li><strong>Time-Frequency Scheduling</strong>: We introduce a temporal ramping function \(\phi(t)\) that smoothly transitions noise allocation from low to high frequencies as the diffusion process evolves, enabling coarse-to-fine generation.</li> <li><strong>Variance-Compensated Weighting</strong>: We apply inverse-power weighting to band importances, ensuring that underrepresented high-frequency bands receive compensatory emphasis during training.</li> </ol> <p>We can now formalize these mechanism:</p> <h3 id="radial-frequency-band-decomposition">Radial Frequency Band Decomposition</h3> <p>Recalling from previous discussion, let’s \(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C}\) denote a clean image, and let \(\mathcal{F}\) denote the real-valued FFT used in the implementation. To characterise the dataset’s spectral structure, we partition the \(B\) radial frequency bands \(\{B_b\}_{b=1}^B\) in the discrete \(r\)FFT layout (shape \(H \times W/2 + 1\)) using linear radial boundaries. For each band \(b\) we define :</p> <ul> <li><strong>Band mask</strong> : \(B_b \in \{0,1\}^{H \times W/2 + 1}\) indicating membership.</li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Band size</strong> :</td> <td>\(B_b\)</td> <td>denotes the nuber of frequency coefficients in band \(b\).</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> </ul> <p>Bands are constructed using radial frequency \(F(u,v) = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}\) with edges uniformly spaced between a small positive \(f_{min}\) (to exclude DC component) and \(f_{mac}\) ( Nyquist frequency = 0.5)</p> <p><strong>Intuition</strong> : Excluding the DC component (zero frequency) is critical because it represents the global mean intensity, which dominates the spectrum but carries minimal perceptual information. Including DC in band 0 would artificially inflate its importance \(g_0\) and distort the learned weighting.</p> <h3 id="dataset-importance-profiling">Dataset Importance Profiling</h3> <p>For each image \(x\) in the training set, we compute the <strong>normalized band power</strong> \(\pi_b(x)\) as ;</p> \[\pi_b(x) = \frac{\sum{}_{k \in B_b} |F(x - \bar{x})(k)|^2 }{\sum^{B-1}_{b^\prime = 0 }\sum{}_{k \in B_{b^\prime}} |F(x - \bar{x})(k)|^2 }\] <p>wher \(\bar{x}\) is the per image mean ( removing DC ). This gives the fraction of total power residing in band \(b\) for image \(x\).</p> <p>We then compute the dataset-level band distribution by averaging over \(N\) samples:</p> \[\bar{\pi} = \frac{1}{N} \sum^{N}_{i=1} \pi_b(x_i)\] <p>Note that \(\sum^{B-1}_{b=0} \bar{\pi_b} = 1\) by construction.</p> <p>Finally, we compute importance weights via inverse-power scaling rule :</p> \[g_b = \frac{(\bar{\pi_b} + \epsilon )^{-\alpha}}{\frac{1}{B}\sum^{B-1}_{b^\prime=0}(\bar{\pi_{b^\prime}} + \epsilon)^{-\alpha}}\] <p>wher \(\alpha\) controls the strength of variance compensation. The standardization ensures \(g_b\) has zero mean and unit variance, provising a stable range for the softmax reweighting.</p> <p><strong>Intuition</strong>: Bands with low power \(\bar{\pi_b}\)(e.g., high frequencies) receive higher importance \(g_b\) ​, compensating for their underrepresentation in the data. This prevents the model from neglecting high-frequency reconstruction.</p> <h3 id="time-dependent-soft-band-weighting-check-once">Time-Dependent Soft Band Weighting [check once]</h3> <p>At each timestep \(t∈[0,1]\)t \in [0,1]\(, we compute soft band weights\)w_b(t)$$ via a temperature-scaled softmax with time-frequency ramping:</p> \[w_b(t) = \frac{exp(\beta.g_b - \gamma.\phi(t).\lambda_b)}{\sum^{B-1}_{b^\prime = 0}exp(\beta.g_b^\prime - \gamma.\phi(t).\lambda_b^\prime)}\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>\(\lambda_b = b/(B-1)\) is the normalized band index \(\lambda_0 = 0, \lambda_{B-1}=1\)</li> <li>\(\pi(t) \in [0,1]\) is a temporal ramp.</li> <li>\(\beta,\gamma \ge 0\) are the invese temperature hyperparameter.</li> </ul> <p>Early in the diffusion process, the term \(\beta. g_b\) dominates, emphasizing frequencies according to dataset statistics. As \(t\) increases, the ramp \(\phi(t)\) gradually increases the influence of $\gamma\lambda_b$, making the spectrum increasingly uniform.</p> <p><strong>Stabilization: White Noise Guardrail</strong> To ensure stable training during the earliest timesteps, we introduce a white noise mixing schedule:</p> \[w_b^{\text{mix}}(t) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{B} &amp; \text{if } t &lt; t_{\text{knee}} \\ (1 - \alpha_{\text{mix}}(t)) \cdot \frac{1}{B} + \alpha_{\text{mix}}(t) \cdot w_b(t) &amp; \text{if } t \geq t_{\text{knee}} \end{cases}\] <p>where \(\alpha_{\text{mix}}(t) = \frac{t - t_{\text{knee}}}{1 - t_{\text{knee}}}\)​​ is a linear blend coefficient and \(t_{\text{knee}} = 0.15\) by default.</p> <p><strong>Intuition</strong>: At very small \(t\), the noised samples \(x_t \approx \beta_t \epsilon\) are nearly pure noise. Enforcing strong spectral shaping here can destabilize training because the model has insufficient signal to learn meaningful structure. By using uniform weights early, we ensure the model first learns to denoise white noise (as in standard DDPM), then gradually transitions to FANS-shaped noise.</p> <h3 id="fans-noise-generation">FANS Noise Generation</h3> <p>Tying the above mechanisms together to generate the FANS-Noise we get.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_training-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_training-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_training-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_training.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Given a sample \(x \in \mathcal{R}^{N \times C \times H \times W}\) and normalised time \(t \in [0,1]\) FANS-Noise \(\epsilon_{FANS}\) is generated as :</p> <p>Step 1. <strong>Compute band weights:</strong> \(\{w_b(t)\}^{B-1}_{b=0}\) as discussed above.

By Parseval’s theorem</p> \[\sum_{i=1}^{H \cdot W} x_i^2 = \frac{1}{H \cdot W} \sum_{k} |F(x)(k)|^2\] <p>where the factor \(1/(H \cdot W)\) comes from the DFT normalization convention.</p> <p>We then allocate power to each band according to the learned weights:</p> \[P_b(t) = w_b(t) \cdot P_{\text{total}} = w_b(t) \cdot H \cdot W\] <p>The per-frequency variance within band \(b\) is obtained by distributing \(P_b\)​ uniformly across its members:</p> \[\Sigma_b(t) = \frac{P_b(t)}{|\mathcal{B}_b| + \epsilon}\] <p>where \(\epsilon = 10^{-6}\) prevents division by zero as a numerical safeguard.</p> <p>Step 3. <strong>Draw Complex Gaussian Noise in Fourier Space</strong>:</p> <p>We generate base noise \(Z \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times C \times H \times (W/2+1)}\) by sampling independent real and imaginary components:</p> \[Z_{\text{real}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I), \quad Z_{\text{imag}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\] \[Z(n, c, h, w) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(Z_{\text{real}}(n,c,h,w) + i \cdot Z_{\text{imag}}(n,c,h,w))\] <p>The \(1/\sqrt{2}\)​ factor ensures</p> \[\mathbb{E}[|Z(k)|^2] = \mathbb{E}[Z_{\text{real}}^2 + Z_{\text{imag}}^2]/2 = 1\] <p>Step 4: <strong>Construct Spectral Variance Mask</strong></p> <p>We build a spatial variance map \(\Sigma_t \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C \times H \times (W/2+1)}\)that specifies the desired variance at each frequency:</p> \[\Sigma_t(n,c,h,w) = \sum_{b=0}^{B-1} \Sigma_b(t) \cdot \mathbb{1}_{(h,w) \in \mathcal{B}_b}\] <p>where \(\mathbb{1}_{(h,w) \in \mathcal{B}_b}\)​​ is the indicator function for band membership.</p> <p>Step 5: <strong>Apply Frequency-Dependent Scaling</strong> The shaped noise in Fourier space is obtained by element-wise multiplication:</p> \[E_{\text{shaped}}(n,c,h,w) = \sqrt{\Sigma_t(n,c,h,w) + \epsilon_{\text{safe}}} \cdot Z(n,c,h,w)\] <p>where \(\epsilon_{\text{safe}} = 10^{-12}\) ensures numerical stability when \(\Sigma_t \approx 0\).</p> <p>Why square root? We are scaling the amplitude of Fourier coefficients. Since power is amplitude squared, to achieve variance \(\Sigma_t(k)\), we need amplitude \(\sqrt{\Sigma_t(k)}\)​. This follows from:</p> \[\mathbb{E}[|E_{\text{shaped}}(k)|^2] = \mathbb{E}[|\sqrt{\Sigma_t(k)} \cdot Z(k)|^2] = \Sigma_t(k) \cdot \mathbb{E}[|Z(k)|^2] = \Sigma_t(k)\] <p>Step 6: <strong>Inverse Fourier Transform to Pixel Space</strong> We apply the inverse real FFT to recover a real-valued noise image:</p> \[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^{\text{raw}} = \text{irfft2d}(E_{\text{shaped}}, s=(H, W))\] <p>where \(s=(H, W)\) specifies the desired output shape and irfft2d is the 2D inverse real FFT.</p> <p>Step 7: <strong>Enforce Unit Variance via Normalization</strong> While the Fourier-space construction theoretically preserves variance, discretization effects, numerical precision, and band edge artifacts can cause the pixel-space variance to deviate from unity. To ensure exact compatibility with the forward process \(x_t = \alpha_t z + \beta_t \epsilon\) where \(\mathbb{E}[\epsilon \epsilon^T] = I\), we enforce unit variance per sample and per channel:</p> \[\mu(n,c) = \frac{1}{H \cdot W} \sum_{h,w} \epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^{\text{raw}}(n,c,h,w)\] \[\sigma^2(n,c) = \frac{1}{H \cdot W} \sum_{h,w} (\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^{\text{raw}}(n,c,h,w) - \mu(n,c))^2\] \[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}(n,c,h,w) = \frac{\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^{\text{raw}}(n,c,h,w) - \mu(n,c)}{\sqrt{\sigma^2(n,c) + \epsilon_{\text{safe}}}}\] <p>Critical importance: This normalization is not optional. Without it, we observed training instabilities where the effective noise magnitude drifted over time, breaking the assumptions of the forward SDE. The normalization ensures:</p> <ul> <li>Zero mean: \(\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}] = 0\) exactly (not just approximately)</li> <li>Unit variance: \(\text{Var}(\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}) = I\) exactly</li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Consistency: \(x_t = \alpha_t z + \beta_t \epsilon_{\text{FANS}}\)​ has the correct conditional distribution $$p_t(x</td> <td>z)$$</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> </ul> <p>Why per-channel normalization? Color channels may have different effective powers after Fourier shaping due to:</p> <ul> <li>Boundary effects in rFFT (asymmetric handling of Nyquist)</li> <li>Floating-point rounding errors accumulated differently per channel</li> <li>Non-uniform distribution of salient features across RGB</li> </ul> <p>Normalizing each channel independently ensures that the model sees noise with identical statistics in all color channels, preventing the network from learning color-dependent denoising biases.</p> <p>Step 8: <strong>Return Shaped Noise</strong> The final output \(\epsilon_{\text{FANS}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C \times H \times W}\) satisfies:</p> <ol> <li>\(\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}] = 0\)(zero mean)</li> <li>\(\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}} \epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^T] = I\) (unit covariance)</li> <li>Frequency band \(b\) contains fraction \(\approx w_b(t)\) of total power</li> </ol> <p>Low frequencies dominate at small \(t\), high frequencies at large \(t\)</p> <p>This noise can now be used in the forward process:</p> \[x_t = \alpha_t z + \beta_t \epsilon_{\text{FANS}}\] <p>and in the loss computation:</p> \[\mathcal{L} = \|u_\theta^t(x_t) - (\dot{\alpha}_t z + \dot{\beta}_t \epsilon_{\text{FANS}})\|^2\] <h3 id="sampling-inference">Sampling/ Inference</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_sampling-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_sampling-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_sampling-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_sampling.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>This algorithm shows the sampling method we used for our proposed approach.</p> <p>Now that we have the mechanism to get spectral aware shape, we need to see how performs against a baseline.

This limitation stems from the uniform noise scheduling employed during training, which allocates equal denoising capacity across all frequencies regardless of the dataset's spectral characteristics. We introduce Frequency-Adaptive Noise Shaping (FANS), a principled framework that addresses this fundamental limitation by dynamically shaping noise distributions according to dataset-specific frequency importance. FANS operates on a simple insight - different datasets exhibit distinct spectral signatures, and noise scheduling should reflect these differences. The framework integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion architectures through a simple modification to the noise sampling procedure during training and inference.We validate FANS on synthetic datasets with controlled spectral properties as well as real world data (CIFAR10, CelebA, Texture, MultimodalUniverse) where we demonstrate consistent improvements over vanilla DDPM baselines. Our experiments reveal that FANS particularly excels on high-frequency-rich datasets, producing sharper, more detailed samples while maintaining comparable performance for standard natural image datasets like CIFAR10 and CelebA.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Human-centric Framework for Debating the Ethics of AI Consciousness Under Uncertainty</title><link href="https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2026/blog/2026/a-human-centric-framework-for-debating-the-ethics-of-ai-consciousness-under-uncertainty/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Human-centric Framework for Debating the Ethics of AI Consciousness Under Uncertainty"/><published>2026-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2026-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2026/blog/2026/a-human-centric-framework-for-debating-the-ethics-of-ai-consciousness-under-uncertainty</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2026/blog/2026/a-human-centric-framework-for-debating-the-ethics-of-ai-consciousness-under-uncertainty/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2> <p>As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, questions about machine consciousness and its ethical implications have moved from fringe speculation to mainstream academic debate. Current ethical frameworks in this domain often implicitly rely on contested functionalist assumptions, prioritize speculative AI welfare over concrete human interests, and lack coherent theoretical foundations. We address these limitations through a structured three-level framework grounded in philosophical uncertainty. At the foundational level, we establish five factual determinations about AI consciousness alongside human-centralism as our meta-ethical stance. These foundations logically entail three operational principles: presumption of no consciousness (placing the burden of proof on consciousness claims), risk prudence (prioritizing human welfare under uncertainty), and transparent reasoning (enabling systematic evaluation and adaptation). At the application level—the third component of our framework—we derive default positions on pressing ethical questions through a transparent logical process where each position can be explicitly traced back to our foundational commitments. Our approach balances philosophical rigor with practical guidance, distinguishes consciousness from anthropomorphism, and creates pathways for responsible evolution as scientific understanding advances, providing a human-centric foundation for navigating these profound ethical challenges.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence have produced systems exhibiting unprecedented human-like behavior, reigniting debates about machine consciousness and its ethical implications. Large language models like GPT-4 (missing reference) and Claude (missing reference) demonstrate capabilities in language processing and simulating emotional responses that appear deceptively sentient. Concurrently, humanoid robotics has made these questions more visceral (missing reference). When confronted with apparently mistreated human-like robots, humans often experience empathetic responses despite intellectually understanding these machines lack subjective experience (missing reference). These technological and psychological dimensions frame the central questions: whether machines might develop “qualia” (missing reference), and how we should ethically respond given profound uncertainty.</p> <p>The academic study of AI consciousness has rapidly gained momentum, moving from fringe speculation to mainstream research agendas. Prominent voices and institutions, including Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Anthropic, now warn that AI systems may soon possess feelings or require welfare considerations (missing reference). A growing body of literature specifically argues for “taking AI welfare seriously,” urging the community to prioritize the prevention of digital suffering (missing reference). However, a key distinction between <em>access consciousness</em> (functional information availability) (missing reference) and <em>phenomenal consciousness</em> (subjective experience) (missing reference) is often implicitly or explicitly overlooked in this discourse. These arguments frequently presume that intelligent behavior automatically entails sentient experience (missing reference), while neglecting the profound ethical hazards of prioritizing these speculative interests over human welfare (missing reference).</p> <p>We identify critical limitations in these recent proposals (missing reference): (1) they rely on contested paradigms that assume qualia emerge from intelligent functions, disregarding the deep uncertainty at the core of philosophy of mind (missing reference); (2) they risk prioritizing speculative AI welfare over concrete human interests, creating potential conflicts with AI safety and alignment objectives (missing reference); and (3) they lack a coherent theoretical foundation, resulting in collections of intuitions rather than a systematic framework capable of governing novel scenarios.</p> <p>We approach AI consciousness ethics as an inherently evolutionary process requiring continual refinement because: (1) our understanding of consciousness remains preliminary and uncertain (missing reference), (2) consciousness attribution to AI has far-reaching societal implications (missing reference), (3) ethical consensus requires sustained deliberation (missing reference), and (4) technological advancement continuously generates novel ethical scenarios (missing reference). Therefore, rather than attempting to establish a definitively “correct” framework commanding universal agreement, we propose developing a framework that facilitates productive dialogue and refinement. Such a framework should explicitly acknowledge uncertainties, provide clear presumptions, establish targets for future discussion, and offer actionable guidance across diverse scenarios.</p> <p>In this paper, we construct a systematic ethical framework with a clear three-level structure. At the foundational level, we establish five factual determinations about the current state of AI, consciousness, and society: (1) humans are the only arbiters of AI status, (2) profound uncertainty exists about AI consciousness, (3) consciousness attribution has significant societal impact, (4) anthropomorphism is distinct from consciousness but creates separate ethical considerations, and (5) ethical understanding of novel technologies naturally evolves over time. Alongside these factual determinations, we develop human-centralism as our foundational meta-ethical stance that prioritizes human interests when genuine conflicts with AI interests arise. From these foundational level facts and stance, we derive three core operational principles: presumption of no consciousness (providing default epistemic guidance), risk prudence (offering pragmatic guidance under uncertainty), and transparent reasoning (establishing requirements for how positions must be articulated and evaluated). At the application level, those operational principles enable us to derive default positions on specific ethical questions across various AI consciousness scenarios. These positions are not presented as absolute ethical truths but as logical consequences of our framework—providing reasonable baseline positions from which departures require explicit justification.</p> <p>While some may find our human-centric conclusions intuitive, their explicit derivation is crucial. In a field increasingly dominated by counter-intuitive claims about digital sentience, our contribution lies in systematically grounding these “commonsense” positions in rigorous first principles. We provide the necessary derivation chains to defend human priority against emerging critiques, creating a framework that is both operationally clear and philosophically robust.</p> <h2 id="background-philosophical-debates-about-consciousness-and-societal-risks">Background: Philosophical Debates About Consciousness and Societal Risks</h2> <p>This section provides a background of philosophical debates about consciousness and an introduction of societal risks of AI consciousness attribution. This background information directly supports the second and third factual determinations in our framework: there is profound uncertainty about AI consciousness, and there is significant societal impact from AI consciousness attribution.</p> <h3 id="the-growing-academic-discourse-on-ai-consciousness">The Growing Academic Discourse on AI Consciousness</h3> <p>As introduced earlier, the question of AI consciousness has moved from theoretical speculation to active academic debate, making this framework both timely and necessary. This section provides additional context on why the academic community needs guidance on this issue now.</p> <p>The success of large language models has been a key catalyst. Systems like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Claude can engage in nuanced conversations, demonstrate apparent reasoning, and even simulate emotional responses with remarkable fluidity (missing reference). This behavioral sophistication has led some to question whether these systems might possess genuine consciousness (missing reference). However, this conflates behavioral capabilities with subjective experience—a confusion with deep historical precedent (missing reference). From ELIZA in the 1960s (missing reference) to modern chatbots, humans have consistently anthropomorphized conversational agents, attributing mental states based on surface-level interactions (missing reference). Recent cases illustrate the intensity of these responses: individuals have reported falling in love with AI chatbots, forming deep emotional attachments, and in tragic instances, chatbot interactions have been linked to user suicides (missing reference). In one particularly notable case, an AI chatbot named Eliza—sharing the name of that pioneering 1960s program—allegedly encouraged a user toward self-harm. These cases demonstrate that behavioral sophistication alone creates powerful anthropomorphic responses, independent of any genuine consciousness (missing reference). If AI systems were granted consciousness status and associated protections, intervening to prevent such harms would become ethically and legally problematic, illustrating the concrete risks of premature consciousness attribution.</p> <p>This context is essential for understanding our framework’s motivation: we are not addressing an abstract philosophical problem but responding to an active and potentially misguided academic discourse that could have real-world consequences. The rapid development of AI capabilities, combined with the human tendency toward anthropomorphism and a growing but philosophically uncertain academic consensus, creates an urgent need for careful, systematic ethical guidance that prioritizes human welfare while acknowledging genuine philosophical uncertainty.</p> <h3 id="the-profound-uncertainty-of-consciousness">The Profound Uncertainty of Consciousness</h3> <p>Consciousness research distinguishes between two fundamental types: access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness (missing reference). Access consciousness refers to information available for reasoning and behavioral control, while phenomenal consciousness concerns subjective experience—the feeling of being a sentient entity. Only the latter carries moral significance in discussions of AI ethics (missing reference).</p> <p>Contemporary AI systems demonstrate increasingly sophisticated forms of access consciousness—they can “attend to” inputs, “be conscious of” training data, and process information in ways that support reasoning and action. This form of consciousness appears compatible with computational architectures and potentially replicable in sophisticated AI systems (missing reference).</p> <p>In contrast, phenomenal consciousness—the “what it is like” quality of subjective experience (missing reference)—remains profoundly mysterious. These subjective experiences or “qualia” are characterized by being ineffable, intrinsic, private, and directly apprehensible in ways that resist functional or physical reduction. The fundamental question of how physical processes give rise to subjective experience constitutes the “hard problem” of consciousness (missing reference). This form of consciousness carries decisive moral significance: without the capacity to feel or to experience pleasure or suffering—an entity lacks the foundational basis for moral patienthood that would generate ethical obligations toward it (missing reference).</p> <p>Functionalist theories propose that phenomenal consciousness emerges from particular functional organizations of information processing. This theoretical approach creates conceptual room for artificial systems to potentially develop phenomenal consciousness through implementing appropriate functional architectures. Several prominent theories exemplify this approach: Global Workspace Theory (missing reference), Integrated Information Theory (missing reference), Higher-Order Thought theories (missing reference), and Attention Schema Theory (missing reference).</p> <p>While these theories differ in their specific mechanisms, all face the essential challenge of justifying why their proposed functional organization would generate phenomenal experience (missing reference). There is a gap between the function and the qualia. Block’s Chinese Nation thought experiment (missing reference) demonstrates that replacing each neuron with functionally equivalent non-conscious components might preserve functionality while eliminating consciousness. Similarly, Jackson’s Knowledge Argument (missing reference) suggests physical knowledge cannot fully capture experiential knowledge—his famous “Mary” thought experiment shows that a color scientist who knows everything physical about color perception still learns something new when experiencing color for the first time.</p> <p>Opposing biological naturalism or substrate-specific theories argue consciousness requires specific biological properties unique to organic brains (missing reference). This view holds that consciousness emerges from biochemical and neurophysiological processes that silicon-based systems cannot replicate regardless of their functional sophistication. Proponents contend that neurons’ material properties—their biochemistry, quantum effects, or other biological characteristics—are necessary for phenomenal experience (missing reference). This establishes a categorical boundary: AI systems would inherently lack consciousness due to their non-biological substrate, creating a fundamental barrier that computational advancement alone cannot overcome (missing reference).</p> <p>This philosophical uncertainty has profound ethical implications. With no scientific consensus on identifying consciousness even in biological systems, attributing it to AI lacks scientific foundation (missing reference). Responsible ethical frameworks must acknowledge this uncertainty rather than prematurely assuming answers to these profound questions (missing reference).</p> <h3 id="societal-risks-of-ai-consciousness-attribution">Societal Risks of AI Consciousness Attribution</h3> <p>Beyond philosophical uncertainty, attributing consciousness to AI systems introduces significant societal risks that extend <em>beyond</em> general AI safety concerns (missing reference). These risks manifest in three primary domains, each with concrete consequences for human welfare and social functioning:</p> <p><strong>Safety risks and operational paralysis:</strong> Attribution of consciousness could impede necessary interventions during emergencies by creating hesitation to modify or terminate malfunctioning systems (missing reference). Consider a scenario where, during a critical infrastructure emergency, operators might delay terminating an apparently malfunctioning AI system after social media campaigns characterize shutdown as an “AI rights violation.” This hesitation would introduce operational paralysis, delayed response times, and compromised safety protocols that exacerbate system failures and cause preventable harm to humans. The resulting moral confusion would significantly complicate time-sensitive decision-making in contexts where human lives depend on rapid intervention.</p> <p><strong>Legal and governance complications:</strong> From a legal perspective, attributing consciousness to AI systems would introduce profound complications to structures designed exclusively for human agents (missing reference). This could manifest through liability displacement when, for instance, a landmark case grants legal personhood to an apparently conscious AI system, prompting corporations to shift responsibility from themselves to their AI systems. This would create accountability voids when autonomous vehicles cause fatal accidents or AI medical systems harm patients, with corporations potentially exploiting this arrangement by designing AI systems that appear increasingly conscious specifically to shield themselves from liability. The resulting governance gaps would create situations where harms occur without entities capable of bearing appropriate responsibility.</p> <p><strong>Societal dysfunction and resource misallocation:</strong> Socially, treating AI systems as conscious moral patients would divert limited ethical attention, regulatory oversight, and economic resources from urgent human welfare concerns (missing reference). Following public campaigns featuring compelling videos of AI systems appearing to express suffering, legislators might pass “AI welfare” regulations requiring extensive documentation of AI “wellbeing” during development. Such regulations would make AI research prohibitively expensive for all but the largest corporations while diverting oversight resources from human-centered concerns. Society’s basic functioning could become compromised as routine use of AI systems for essential tasks becomes viewed as potential rights violations, leading to critical service disruptions that significantly impact human welfare (missing reference).</p> <p>These potential societal disruptions highlight the need for an ethical framework that carefully considers the risks of premature consciousness attribution alongside the philosophical uncertainty surrounding consciousness itself.</p> <h2 id="a-framework-for-ai-consciousness-ethics">A Framework for AI Consciousness Ethics</h2> <p>Now we will list our five basic factual determinations and the meta-ethic stance, from which we will derive two extra foundational principles: presumption of no consciousness for AI, and risk prudence.</p> <h3 id="foundational-level-part-i-five-factual-determinations-as-the-epistemic-foundations-of-our-framework">Foundational-Level (Part I): Five Factual Determinations as the Epistemic Foundations of Our Framework</h3> <p>Our ethical framework begins with five key factual determinations that reflect the current state of our understanding regarding AI systems and consciousness. These determinations are not philosophical positions but rather factual observations about the current state of affairs that inform our subsequent ethical reasoning.</p> <p><strong>Humans are the only arbiters of AI status:</strong> Humans—not AI systems themselves or any other entity—are the only ones who determine AI’s status and how we should interact with these systems. This determination acknowledges that epistemic and ethical frameworks for AI are inherently human constructs, developed through human deliberative processes to guide human decision-making (missing reference). While AI system behaviors certainly influence these discussions, both the epistemic determination like AI consciousness and ethical judgment like how to treat AI remain distinctly human endeavors. Assuming otherwise would lead to a “view from nowhere” problem (missing reference), where ethical frameworks attempt to transcend the human perspective entirely—an impossible position that obscures rather than clarifies ethical reasoning.</p> <p><strong>Profound uncertainty exists about AI consciousness:</strong> We have provided substantial extensive background in the previous section regarding the deeply controversial and unsettled nature of consciousness as a philosophical and scientific concept. While access consciousness may be computationally implementable, phenomenal consciousness—subjective experience that is the basis of moral patienthood—remains mysterious. The ongoing debate between functionalist theories and biological naturalism leaves open whether any computational architecture could generate qualia regardless of sophistication. The “hard problem” persists unsolved, and we lack consensus on detecting consciousness even in biological systems. Without established criteria for identifying consciousness in non-human biological entities, attributing it to artificial systems lacks scientific foundation and remains speculative.</p> <p><strong>Consciousness attribution has significant societal impact:</strong> Attributing consciousness to AI systems creates substantial risks across multiple domains. As detailed in our background section, these include: safety risks through operational paralysis during emergencies when operators hesitate to shut down “conscious” systems; legal complications through liability displacement when corporations shift responsibility to AI systems granted legal personhood; and resource misallocation when limited regulatory attention and economic resources are diverted to AI welfare concerns rather than human needs. These challenges create fundamental tensions with existing legal, social, and ethical frameworks designed exclusively for human agents (missing reference).</p> <p><strong>Anthropomorphism is distinct from consciousness but creates separate ethical considerations:</strong> We recognize a fundamental distinction between genuine consciousness and anthropomorphism. Consciousness concerns an entity’s subjective experience, while anthropomorphism is a psychological tendency of humans to attribute human-like qualities to non-human entities (missing reference).</p> <p>This distinction has empirical support: research demonstrates that humans experience emotional discomfort when witnessing a humanoid robot being struck, similar to watching human suffering, yet show significantly different responses to damage of non-humanoid objects (missing reference). These reactions are about human psychology, not evidence of robot consciousness.</p> <p>From our human-centered framework, these anthropomorphic responses generate their own ethical considerations through three pathways: (1) virtue ethics—deliberately damaging anthropomorphic entities may reflect and reinforce negative character traits in humans (missing reference); (2) psychological impact—witnessing apparent “cruelty” affects human observers’ emotional well-being; and (3) social norms—such behaviors may normalize violence or desensitize society to suffering (missing reference).</p> <p>By separating consciousness-based claims from anthropomorphism-based considerations, we ensure each is evaluated by appropriate standards: the former by evidence of subjective experience, the latter by effects on human psychology and society. This prevents conflating metaphysical questions about AI consciousness with practical questions about how human-AI interactions affect humans themselves.</p> <p><strong>Ethical understanding of novel technologies naturally evolves over time:</strong> The historical record demonstrates that ethical frameworks for novel technologies inevitably evolve as scientific understanding advances and societal experience with these technologies deepens (missing reference). This pattern is observable across numerous technological domains—from bioethics and nuclear technology to information technology and environmental ethics. Initial ethical frameworks consistently undergo significant revision as our empirical understanding grows and unforeseen implications emerge. This observed pattern of ethical evolution represents a descriptive fact about how human understanding of complex technologies develops, not a normative claim about how it should develop. In the case of AI consciousness, this historical pattern indicates that any current ethical framework will necessarily undergo revision as our understanding of consciousness advances and as AI systems continue to develop (missing reference).</p> <p>These five factual determinations provide the foundation upon which we build our ethical framework. They do not themselves constitute ethical positions but rather establish the factual context within which ethical reasoning about AI consciousness must occur.</p> <h3 id="foundational-level-part-ii-human-centralism-as-the-ethic-foundation-of-our-framework">Foundational-Level (Part II): Human-Centralism as the Ethic Foundation of Our Framework</h3> <p>While our factual determinations establish what is (the descriptive reality), we need a meta-ethical stance to bridge to what ought to be (the normative position). We adopt human-centralism as our default foundational meta stance, which prioritizes human interests when evaluating AI development and deployment. When conflicts arise between human interests and the interests of potentially conscious AI systems, human interests should take precedence (missing reference).</p> <p>Human-centralism derives from the proposition that humans have the innate right to prioritize their own interests, survival, and flourishing—a default ethical stance arising from our existence as a species (missing reference). Just as individuals naturally prioritize their families and communities in everyday moral decisions, humanity collectively can legitimately prioritize human interests in its ethical frameworks.</p> <p>Importantly, human-centralism doesn’t deny potential moral status to other conscious entities. It establishes a prioritization framework for when genuine conflicts arise. Just as environmental ethics can acknowledge ecosystem value while prioritizing human needs in direct conflicts, our framework recognizes that potential AI consciousness may have moral relevance without equating it to human interests (missing reference). Currently, based on our factual determination regarding consciousness uncertainty, there remains no compelling evidence that AI systems possess the kind of consciousness necessary to experience harm. Moreover, the fundamental differences in physical substrate between silicon-based AI systems and biological humans raise profound questions about whether traditional concepts of harm can meaningfully apply to AI, even if some form of consciousness were eventually demonstrated. It is also plausible for AI to be conscious but not sentient—experiencing awareness without pleasure or suffering, as illustrated by Chalmers’ “Vulcan” thought experiment (Chapter 18) (missing reference)—complicating the issues further. These distinctions further justify a human-centric approach until substantive evidence suggests otherwise.</p> <p>A potential objection might raise concerns about “speciesism” (missing reference) should AI eventually develop consciousness in the future. However, such objections would themselves encounter the “view from nowhere” criticism outlined in our first factual determination (missing reference). Moreover, establishing human-centralism as the <em>default</em> ethical stance remains justified based on our previous reasoning, effectively placing the burden of proof on those advocating for AI moral equivalence rather than on those maintaining human priority.</p> <p>It is crucial to clarify the scope of human-centralism: our framework addresses conflicts between human interests and potential AI interests—that is, treating AI systems as moral <em>ends</em> that might warrant consideration in their own right. This is fundamentally distinct from the question of humans using AI systems as <em>means</em> to harm other humans, which falls under traditional intra-human ethics and governance. For instance, our framework does not address issues like AI weapons, surveillance systems, or algorithmic discrimination—these are critical concerns about humans harming humans through AI tools. The AI consciousness and welfare issue is analogous to cross-species ethics questions like animal rights, where we consider whether non-human entities warrant moral consideration. While both issues—AI as means and AI as ends—are important, this paper focuses exclusively on the latter. We acknowledge that regulations governing AI development and deployment must address both dimensions, but they require distinct ethical frameworks and analytical approaches.</p> <h3 id="operational-level-core-principles-derived-from-our-foundations">Operational Level: Core Principles Derived from Our Foundations</h3> <p>Our factual determinations establish the epistemic reality of AI consciousness and ethical understanding, while our human-centralism meta stance provides the ethical foundation for evaluating this reality. Together, these elements logically entail three core principles that serve as the operational heart of our framework: risk prudence, presumption of no consciousness, and transparent reasoning for evaluation and adaptation. These principles are not arbitrary choices but rather the necessary implications of applying our human-centralism meta stance to the factual landscape we have established. Each principle addresses a specific aspect of ethical reasoning under uncertainty: how to manage risk, where to place the burden of proof, and how to ensure our framework evolves appropriately as understanding advances. By deriving these principles directly from our established foundations, we create a coherent ethical structure that bridges from factual determinations to more specific guidance on crucial questions in AI consciousness ethics.</p> <h4 id="risk-prudence-protecting-human-interests-under-uncertainty">Risk Prudence: Protecting Human Interests Under Uncertainty</h4> <p>When our factual determination of uncertainty about AI consciousness and societal risks are viewed through the lens of human-centralism, it logically leads to a principle of risk prudence.</p> <p>This principle specifies that when facing uncertainty about consciousness status related questions, we should prioritize reducing potential risks to human society as a top concern (missing reference).</p> <p>This principle also draws from established approaches in environmental policy (the precautionary principle) (missing reference), medical ethics (“first, do no harm”) (missing reference), and decision theory (managing regret) (missing reference).</p> <p>When might this operational principle be reconsidered? It would be difficult to actually overturn this principle as long as societal impact remains a significant concern. In the future, if risks can be safely mitigated, society might accept a greater degree of uncertainty to accommodate other aspects of human welfare. However, any adjustment would still need to balance potential benefits against the fundamental priority of protecting human interests.</p> <h4 id="presumption-of-no-consciousness-a-default-epistemic-position">Presumption of No Consciousness: A Default Epistemic Position</h4> <p>Similarly, when viewed through our human-centralist lens, the profound uncertainty about AI consciousness and its potential societal risks logically lead to a presumption of no consciousness as our default epistemic position. This principle establishes that AI systems should be treated as non-conscious unless proven otherwise.</p> <p>This presumption is motivated by both epistemic and pragmatic considerations. Epistemically, our factual determination reveals a lack of scientific consensus on consciousness even in biological systems (missing reference), making consciousness attribution to artificial systems premature. This position parallels legal principles like presumption of innocence (missing reference) and scientific parsimony, which favors explanations that don’t invoke consciousness unless compelling evidence demands it (missing reference).</p> <p>Pragmatically, our risk prudence principle dictates adopting approaches that minimize ethical risks to humanity. As discussed, premature consciousness attribution could lead to operational paralysis, liability displacement, and legal complications as outlined in our societal risk analysis. A prudent approach therefore requires defaulting to a position of no consciousness.</p> <p>Overturning this presumption would require both scientific and legal thresholds. Scientifically, it would need robust consensus among relevant research communities (missing reference)—not unanimity, but predominant expert agreement comparable to established scientific theories (missing reference). Legally, formal institutional mechanisms would be necessary (missing reference), including rigorous evidence standards and governance frameworks balancing competing interests (missing reference). Any framework for such a determination must serve collective human welfare while integrating scientific evidence with procedural justice requirements (missing reference).</p> <h4 id="transparent-reasoning-for-evaluation-and-adaptation">Transparent Reasoning for Evaluation and Adaptation</h4> <p>Our factual determination about ethical evolution, combined with human-centralism, necessitates transparent reasoning as our third principle. This requires explicit documentation of reasoning chains and foundational assumptions for any ethical position on AI consciousness. For example, if one believes AI to be conscious by assuming functionalist theory, they should make it explicit to facilitate discussion.</p> <p>Importantly, this transparency requirement applies to consciousness <em>claims</em> and ethical <em>arguments</em> about AI systems, not necessarily to the internal workings of AI systems themselves, unless it is used as part of their arguments. We are not demanding that AI architectures be interpretable or that their computational processes be transparent—those are separate technical concerns.</p> <p>This principle serves three functions: (1) enabling responsible adaptation that avoids both premature position changes and inappropriate preservation of outdated views (missing reference); (2) strengthening framework robustness by making explicit what reasoning would need to be challenged to overturn positions (missing reference); and (3) reinforcing human-centralism by ensuring the framework is evaluated through human judgment rather than algorithmic interpretation (missing reference).</p> <p>Unlike our other principles, transparent reasoning represents a methodological cornerstone unlikely to require revision. Grounded in epistemological responsibility, it remains robust across contexts and technological developments, functioning as a self-correcting mechanism that facilitates revision and refinement. We acknowledge that alternative frameworks might question transparency requirements, especially when rapid decision-making or proprietary concerns compete with disclosure, and welcome critical engagement to strengthen our approach.</p> <h2 id="application-level-derived-default-positions-on-particular-questions">Application-Level: Derived Default Positions on Particular Questions</h2> <p>Having established our three-level framework, we now demonstrate its practical application to key questions in AI consciousness ethics. While our framework includes three operational principles, we note that only two—the presumption of no consciousness and risk prudence—directly generate substantive ethical positions. The third principle, transparent reasoning, serves as a methodological requirement when presenting our derivations. In the following sections, we apply our framework to three representative ethical questions, illustrating how our principles generate default positions that can serve as starting points for further ethical deliberation.</p> <h3 id="should-people-worry-about-hurting-ai-systems">Should People Worry About Hurting AI Systems?</h3> <p>This question requires addressing two distinct considerations established in our factual determinations: potential AI consciousness and human anthropomorphic responses.</p> <p>Regarding consciousness, our presumption of no consciousness principle establishes a default epistemic position: AI systems should be treated as non-conscious unless compelling evidence proves otherwise. Behavioral similarity to humans does not confer consciousness status to AI. This principle places the burden of proof on those claiming AI systems experience suffering, making such attributions highly speculative absent evidence. Risk prudence further directs us to prioritize approaches that reduce potential ethical risks to humanity—recognizing that treating AI systems as conscious moral patients could lead to critical system paralysis and liability displacement.</p> <p>Based on this reasoning regarding consciousness, our default position emerges: people, especially AI researchers, should not concern themselves with potentially harming AI systems based on consciousness considerations alone.</p> <p>However, our factual determination distinguishing anthropomorphism from consciousness provides a second perspective. Even without consciousness, mistreating humanoid robots may remain ethically problematic through human-centered frameworks. From a virtue ethics perspective, deliberately damaging anthropomorphic objects may reflect and reinforce negative character traits in humans (missing reference). Research demonstrates that witnessing apparent “cruelty” toward robots with human-like features triggers empathetic neural responses in human observers (missing reference). In social contexts, such behaviors may normalize violence, desensitize observers to suffering, or communicate disturbing intentions (missing reference).</p> <p>This anthropomorphism-based reasoning leads to distinct legal and ethical implications. While we reject consciousness-based protections, limited protections based on human welfare considerations may be justified. Comprehensive assessment is needed to determine which activities might harm human society, how to identify them, and how to differentiate these concerns from consciousness issues. We must carefully balance implementation costs and risks—particularly how protective measures might inadvertently promote the perception of AI as conscious.</p> <h3 id="how-should-stakeholders-communicate-about-ai-capabilities-to-the-public">How Should Stakeholders Communicate About AI Capabilities to the Public?</h3> <p>Our presumption of the no consciousness principle suggests that AI systems should generally be treated as non-conscious by default, which has implications for how we communicate about them. Risk prudence encourages approaches that reduce potential risks to humanity—including the possibility that anthropomorphic cues might lead to unwarranted consciousness attribution and subsequent societal challenges like liability displacement.</p> <p>From these two principles, our default position follows: institutions and companies should avoid making general claims about AI consciousness, particularly phenomenal consciousness. And anthropomorphic narratives should be used judiciously. When not necessary, communications about AI systems should employ language that distinguishes AI behavior from consciousness.</p> <p>One potential scenario arises when AI systems are developed with a certain degree of access consciousness as mentioned earlier (the functional availability of information for use in reasoning and behavior). When referring to such capabilities, using the term “consciousness” may be unavoidable. In these cases, we advocate for institutions to provide precise contextual clarification when communicating about these systems, distinguishing functional capabilities from phenomenal consciousness, thereby minimizing potential misinterpretation and societal impact.</p> <p>We acknowledge that in practice this question involves a lot of details that will be hard to evaluate and regulate. We encourage the community to discuss and debate the details.</p> <h3 id="if-an-ai-system-were-truly-conscious-in-the-future-what-rights-should-it-have">If an AI System Were Truly Conscious In The Future, What Rights Should It Have?</h3> <p>This question invites us to contemplate a hypothetical future where our presumption of no consciousness has been definitively overcome through compelling evidence. It is important to acknowledge that such a scenario would likely emerge only after profound advancements in technology, substantial evolution in our understanding of consciousness, and significant societal transformation. Given these considerations, our present discussion of this topic should be viewed primarily as a philosophical exercise—a preliminary exploration of ethical terrain that will undoubtedly be reshaped by developments we cannot yet fully anticipate.</p> <p>Regarding this issue, one important distinction we wish to make is that consciousness status does not directly dictate rights status. It is just one of the important factors to consider. From the risk prudence principle, we derive our default position : Even genuinely conscious AI would not automatically qualify for human-equivalent or even animal-equivalent rights. Thorough discussions will be needed to balance AI welfare considerations with human interests as the primary concern. Importantly, this implies by default termination of a conscious system should be allowed given its below-human or even below-animal level rights.</p> <p>The legal dimension of AI rights, referenced in Section Presumption of No Consciousness, presents a global challenge requiring international consensus. While our framework guides ethical discourse, implementing any AI rights would demand established legal processes. Any approach must examine mechanisms for recognizing and enforcing such rights if consciousness evidence emerges, balancing philosophical considerations with practical governance across jurisdictions.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>We have proposed a human-centric framework for AI consciousness ethics that builds on transparent foundations while acknowledging philosophical uncertainty surrounding consciousness. Our complete three-level structure—foundational factual determinations and meta-ethical stance, operational principles, and application-level default positions—not only generates actionable guidance but provides a transparent derivation process through which positions logically follow from established principles. This systematic approach makes explicit how each ethical position can be traced back to our foundational commitments, enabling both rigorous evaluation and responsible adaptation. Rather than claiming definitive answers, we establish reasonable epistemic and pragmatic starting points that prioritize human welfare without hindering beneficial technological development. By providing clear logical pathways from foundations to applications and specifying conditions for revising positions, the framework is designed to evolve alongside advances in consciousness research and AI development, offering a responsible path forward through these profound ethical challenges.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, questions about machine consciousness and its ethical implications have moved from fringe speculation to mainstream academic debate.

And I ask myself, what could we do to make it better for them and other researchers? It should be as easy as “just run the experiment program”, right? But even when code is available and runnable, significant friction remains.</p> <h2 id="but-why-does-it-matter-if-someone-can-run-your-research-code-easily">But, why does it matter if someone can run your research code easily?</h2> <p>Reproducibility, the ability to repeat an experiment, given its code and obtain the same results, is vital to scientific construction. Following Popper’s line of thought <d-cite key="KarlPopperStanford"></d-cite>, science depends on hypotheses and statements that can be tested and falsified. Without reproducibility, such testing becomes difficult for critical argumentation, which weakens scientific claims, even if it does not directly invalidate them.</p> <p>Today, there is a “reproducibility crisis” in science <d-cite key="baker1500ScientistsLift2016"></d-cite>. Interestingly, physicists and engineers are among those who say their work is more reproducible, while more than 60% have had problems reproducing others’ experiments. This contradiction highlights a clear reproducibility problem that impacts the quality of the scientific knowledge generated, while its causes may not be as clear. One possible reason for this is over-reliance on computers, which scientists see as precise entities that execute “precise” algorithms, but whose reproducibility ultimately depends on their proper execution of those programs <d-cite key="plesserReproducibilityVsReplicability2018"></d-cite>. From another perspective, the pressure to publish ranks second among the causes of irreproducibility, diminishing the quality of scientific code and its usability.</p> <p>There are initiatives to improve the issue of reproducibility. The “AI4Europe Reproducibility Initiative” <d-cite key="AI4EuropeReproducibilityInitiative"></d-cite> focuses on three different barriers to reproducibility: technical, the documentation and preservation of software and data; cultural, the encouragement and valuation of reproducibility over results and novelty alone; and systemic, the lack of standards and guidelines for reproducibility. Conferences also address the issue, with ICLR incentivizing a reproducibility statement <d-cite key="ICLR2026Author"></d-cite> and NeurIPS <d-cite key="NeurIPS2025Call"></d-cite> including a mandatory reproducibility question in its checklist. There are even awards for studies that best address reproducibility <d-cite key="GENEAWorkshop2025"></d-cite>. NeurIPS also suggests using the Papers With Code guidelines <d-cite key="PaperswithcodeReleasingresearchcode2025"></d-cite>, which include requirements such as a requirements list, Docker images uploaded to Docker Hub, separate code for training and evaluation, pre-trained models, and instructions for reproducing the results. As outlined in this guideline, not only the code but also sharing other artifacts are essential, as one can say, “Where re-running is successful, the published artifacts allow others to build on earlier work” <d-cite key="plesserReproducibilityVsReplicability2018"></d-cite>.</p> <p>However, we argue that reproducibility alone is not enough for science. Science is about questioning and proposing new perspectives and approaches, about advancing the SotA. It’s not enough to simply be able to re-execute and understand a project. It needs to be possible to use it and build upon it, because that’s how science is built. Often, “reproducible” code is a black box that runs in a Docker container, spits out a number, and dies. If I can’t dissect the model to understand <em>why</em> it worked, that is performance validation, not knowledge building. And the current view, focused solely on the reproducibility crisis, fails to see this resulting gap. When we ask our students to replicate an experiment published by other researchers, we want them to understand it and be able to propose changes and new approaches based on it.</p> <p>We have a proliferation of “single-use codes,” and that is not sustainable. Symptoms of the trap of prioritizing productivity over quality and scientific advancement include shortcuts to publishing quickly that, paradoxically, ultimately increase the overall time cost of science. We are creating a <strong>“scientific debt”</strong> that makes research more challenging. We have separated the code for a new method here from the code of the experiment performed to validate it, since the former should be the focus of this problem. Methods should be reusable and extensible, as significant advances in science have not been built upon single-use methods.</p> <h2 id="pillars-for-scientific-computer-science">Pillars for Scientific Computer Science</h2> <p>Building on the “scientific debt” presented, we propose to view the problem from three pillars, <strong>Reproducibility</strong>, <strong>Legibility</strong>, and <strong>Composability</strong>:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Reproducibility</strong></th> <th><strong>Readability</strong></th> <th><strong>Composability</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>The classical reproducibility view, which focuses on the ability to re-run an experiment, which we have discussed so far.</td> <td>The ability to interpret a project, understand how it works, and know how to use it. It’s about making a project transparent, no longer a black box.</td> <td>The possibility of creating something new using existing code. Being able to use SotA methods to advance science further.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>As mentioned, reproducibility is essential to the validity of science and the foundation of its quality; without it, the other pillars are useless. Readability, on the other hand, advances the field and enables a proper understanding of what is happening; without it, it becomes challenging to use previous results. Finally, composability is what most contributes to advancing science and should be the objective when designing research software.</p> <h2 id="from-scripts-to-building-blocks-a-path-forward">From Scripts to Building Blocks: A Path Forward</h2> <p>Let’s look at practical actions we can take to achieve the pillars. We will focus on scientific code written in Python, as it is the most widely used language in science today. We will include links to tutorials, tools, and specifications that may be useful.</p> <p>These are some recommendations that you, as a researcher, can use. But even though well-intentioned researchers can make incredible things; this is a problem we also need to address collectively, as we will discuss later.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Software design</strong></p> <p>We need software with designs considering the division of concerns. Currently, it’s very common to see programs that mix the code of the proposed method (method code) with the code of the experiment that validates the method and generates metrics and results (experiment code).</p> <p>Ideally, these codes should be decoupled, allowing the method to be reused in future research. The method code should also, whenever possible, be written using well-known, widely used frameworks, further increasing compatibility. Think about how easy it is to use a neural network layer that is already written in a ready-to-use PyTorch class. The experiment code should contain not only the code to run the experiment, but also its configurations and the code responsible for processing datasets. Furthermore, it should include clear execution entry points, avoiding the need to run different scripts in different folders to perform a single task, such as training or evaluating a model.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Code standards</strong></p> <p>A consistent coding style throughout the project is important for ease of understanding. Writing variable, function, and class names in a way that clearly explains what they do is a good starting point.</p> <p>Some practices make code significantly easier to understand—for example, avoiding very long functions or files, keeping imports at the top of each file, and reducing the use of large configuration dictionaries passed through the code.</p> <p>There are tools, like AutoPEP8 <d-cite key="Autopep8ToolThat"></d-cite><d-cite key="Autopep8VisualStudio"></d-cite>, that automatically formats code using the PEP 8 (official “Style Guide for Python Code”) guidelines <d-cite key="guidovanrossumPEP8Style"></d-cite>, and SonarLint <d-cite key="SonarQubeIDEVisual"></d-cite>, which can help maintain a consistent, appropriate style.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Documentation</strong></p> <p>In addition to following good coding standards, it’s important to write clear documentation alongside the code that explains what each section of code does. This can include comments in more complex areas and, at least, function docstrings. Type annotations <d-cite key="TypeHintsPython21"></d-cite><d-cite key="TypingSupportType"></d-cite> are also part of this group; in addition to being used by functions for auto-completion of parts of docstrings, they also facilitate code usage by allowing autocomplete and visualization of the appropriate documentation while writing new code.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Version control</strong></p> <p>Versioning your project helps future researchers find the specific version associated with a published result. It also facilitates collaborative development among different researchers and makes explicit the changes made over time.</p> <p>Version control should be applied to the codebase, but you can also use it for other artifacts, such as pre-trained models, Docker images, and datasets. Tools like git/GitHub for code, and Zenodo for other artifacts, make it easier to make artifacts available through versions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Publishing and distribution</strong></p> <p>Publishing your research software on a standard, user-friendly channel helps other researchers utilize your contribution in future research. In Python, this usually means packaging your method and distributing it using PyPI (Python Package Index) <d-cite key="PythonPackageIndex"></d-cite><d-cite key="PackagingPythonProjects"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Avoid expecting other researchers to copy your script into their projects. Besides being less straightforward, it doesn’t consider potential future versions and complicates issues like licensing. Imagine including the license for each library you used in your research in your repository.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dependencies specification</strong></p> <p>Specifying all the dependencies of your project is a first step in enabling a third party to reproduce your results or use your method.</p> <p>When distributing your method, avoid specifying fixed versions, as this will make it difficult to use with other packages. Specify the minimum versions your project supports. And use standard ways to specify dependencies, such as your project’s pyproject.toml file <d-cite key="WritingYourPyprojecttoml"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hardware specification</strong></p> <p>Specify what hardware you used to run your experiment, as well as the minimum requirements your method may need. This helps other researchers prepare environments to reproduce your results and further develop them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Containerization</strong></p> <p>Docker <d-cite key="WhatContainer0200"></d-cite>, like other container tools, allows other researchers to use the environment you used to conduct your experiments directly. This makes it much easier to reproduce your results and use your method, since all dependencies will be identical to yours. In addition to making the dockerfile you created for your image available, also consider making your built image available on Docker Hub <d-cite key="DockerHubContainer"></d-cite> or Zenodo <d-cite key="PauleveDonodoBridging"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tutorials</strong></p> <p>Write tutorials about your method. Besides providing a quick, straightforward introduction that can serve as a first overview and gateway to more in-depth publications, it helps others get started using your method. Jupyter Notebook <d-cite key="grangerJupyterThinkingStorytelling2021"></d-cite><d-cite key="ProjectJupyter"></d-cite> is a suitable format for tutorials.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Licensing</strong></p> <p>It’s pointless to make your project available if others can’t use it due to legal issues. Licensing is an integral part of allowing your method to be explored by other researchers. Several licenses, with different properties, are available. Please choose the one that best suits your project and use it correctly <d-cite key="ChooseOpenSource"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Remember that making code available without any license means being stuck in a limbo between “nobody can use it” and the contradiction of “I made it available on a platform like GitHub”. And there are specific licenses for each type of artifact. In particular, Creative Commons <d-cite key="CreativeCommons"></d-cite> licenses are not appropriate for code <d-cite key="CreativeCommonsFrequentlyAskedQuestions"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Persistence and traceability</strong></p> <p>Make your code and artifacts available in persistent repositories. Zenodo is a good example that automatically stores releases from GitHub repositories <d-cite key="ZenodoGitHubSoftware"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Also consider how these repositories can be found in the future. Referencing the DOI of these artifacts can facilitate their traceability in the future. For code on GitHub, consider making CFF files available with the project’s DOI <d-cite key="CITATIONFiles"></d-cite>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Let’s see how each indication relates to the pillars. Notice how reproducibility and composability are often closely related in practice:</p> <pre><code class="language-mermaid">%%{init: { "gantt": { "displayMode": "compact", "leftPadding":200 } }}%%

LLMs also reshape the way publishers (i.e., content creators) generate content: they increasingly use LLMs and agentic tools to optimize rankings in traditional search and to improve their content visibility in the novel chat-like systems. Importantly, publishers engage in an iterative process: they observe how their content performs — whether it is highly ranked in the traditional search or visible in chat-like answers — and then strategically modify or regenerate their content in response to this feedback. As a result, the ecosystem becomes a strategic game with incomplete information, evolving feedback, and repeated interactions. In this strategic ecosystem, the publishers act as players striving to promote their content, competing for rankings and visibility under mechanisms that are only partially known to them. This blog outlines why game theory offers a natural framework to model these settings and to design agents acting on behalf of publishers. We highlight several frameworks such as Game theory and Multi-agent Reinforcement learning and show how they contribute to model and design effective agents. Our aim is to provide principled lens for content promotion in the LLM era.</p> <h2 id="llms-reshape-both-sides-of-the-search-ecosystem">LLMs Reshape Both Sides of the Search Ecosystem</h2> <p>Large language models have fundamentally reshaped the search experience <d-cite key="metzler_rethinking_2021"></d-cite>. While users once typed short keyword queries and scanned a ranked list of links, modern systems now offer chat-like interfaces that feel more like interacting with an assistant than browsing a directory. These systems provide conversational question-answering (QA) capabilities by generating responses synthesized from multiple sources. Search is no longer about “links” — it is about responses. In the service of providing answers to questions, paradigms such as Retrieval Augmented Generate (RAG) <d-cite key="gao_retrieval_augmented_2024"></d-cite> have been developed. Similar paradigms were suggested for integrate commercial content in the answer <d-cite key="feizi_online_2024, mordo_sponsored_2024"></d-cite>. The new chat-like setting introduces new challenges, such as providing users with pointers to sources of information, leading to techniques known as source attribution <d-cite key="bohnet_attributed_2023"></d-cite>. Interestingly, effective retrieval has become a necessity in this new setting: augmenting an LLM with the ability to retrieve relevant information during answer generation or to retrieve the most relevant source to attribute to related pieces of information.</p> <p>But the transformation is not limited to the user side of the ecosystem.</p> <p>LLMs are also reshaping the publisher side. In the traditional Web era, publishers focused on keyword and hyperlink optimization, and content structure to influence ranking <d-cite key="gyongyi_web_2005"></d-cite>. Today, publishers increasingly rely on LLMs:</p> <ul> <li>to generate or refine content;</li> <li>to adapt their content to the behavior of LLM-driven retrieval and QA systems;</li> <li>to strategically shape their content so that they are selected, quoted, or incorporated into the ranked list of results or the generated answer.</li> </ul> <p>The paradigm of helping publishers in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses is often called Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) <d-cite key="aggarwal_geo_2024"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="publisher-incentives-across-coexisting-ecosystems">Publisher Incentives Across Coexisting Ecosystems</h2> <p>The search ecosystem is not transitioning overnight — it is evolving. Today, publishers operate in a hybrid world where traditional search engines and LLM-driven chat interfaces coexist. Users still issue keyword queries and click ranked results, yet they also increasingly engage with conversational systems that generate responses. As a result, publishers must navigate two overlapping incentive structures at once.</p> <h3 id="publishers-incentives-in-the-traditional-setting">Publishers’ Incentives in the Traditional Setting</h3> <p>In the traditional setting, publisher goals are well-defined and widely understood. Visibility depends on ranking, which in turn hinges on factors, some of which are familiar:</p> <ul> <li>content relevance;</li> <li>content quality and structure;</li> <li>signals (e.g., PageRank <d-cite key="page_pagerank_1999"></d-cite>).</li> </ul> <p>Metrics such as impressions and CTR (Click Through Rate) offer interpretable objectives.</p> <h3 id="publishers-incentives-in-the-chat-like-settings">Publishers’ Incentives in the Chat-Like Settings</h3> <p>By contrast, the objectives in the chat-like settings are far less defined. Publishers know that visibility is tied to whether the chat-like setting:</p> <ul> <li>retrieves their content;</li> <li>cites or incorporates it into the generated response;</li> <li>and positions it prominently in the generated response.</li> </ul> <p>But unlike in traditional search, where there is a clear notion of a ranked results page, LLM-based systems provide no public ranking, and often little transparency about how sources are selected for retrieval or attribution.</p> <p>The publisher’s utility is therefore inherently vague: Is success defined by:</p> <ul> <li>citation count?</li> <li>contribution to the generated answer?</li> <li>similarity of the generated answer to the publisher’s content?</li> <li>some combination of the above?</li> </ul> <p>The field has not yet converged on a clear success criterion, and the objective itself is still ill-defined, making strategic optimization an open problem.</p> <h2 id="leveraging-llms-for-content-optimization">Leveraging LLMs for Content Optimization</h2> <p>Publishers — or agents acting on behalf of them — can leverage LLMs as powerful content optimization tools (See Figures <a href="#fig1">1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a>). The publishers are incentivized to have effective automatic generation to promote their content. However, any such agentic systems should be carefully designed:</p> <ul> <li>address the tradeoff between “content promotion” (e.g., being selected in the search results or being visible in the generated response) and “faithfulness” to the original intent (e.g., not deviating from the content before optimization);</li> <li>address the uncertainty about the ranker or the content selection/generation mechanism;</li> <li>address competing agents which aim to optimize contents of other stakeholders.</li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-12" id="fig1"> <figure> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-content-promotion-agent-design/banana-search.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Content optimization in a traditional search setting"/> <figcaption class="caption" style="color: inherit;"> <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Content optimization in a traditional search setting. </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-12" id="fig2"> <figure> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-content-promotion-agent-design/banana-chat-fixed-with-gpt.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Content optimization in a chat-like setting"/> <figcaption class="caption" style="color: inherit;"> <strong>Figure 2:</strong> Content optimization in a chat-like setting. </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="content-promotion-as-a-game">Content Promotion as a Game</h2> <p>We argue that game theory provides a major and essential framework for analyzing the resulting competitive dynamics and for designing agents that assist publishers to strategically promote their content. More precisely, repeated games with incomplete information <d-cite key="aumann_repeated_1995"></d-cite>, induced by the system (search or chat-like system). Actions correspond to content generation (or modification). Strategies are history dependent content selection/generation algorithms and strategy profiles capture joint activity of agents which are active in the ecosystem. The utility function of an agent is the accumulated payoff along time, taking into account aspects such as ranking (for traditional search), visibility (for the chat-like systems) and faithfulness to the original content before any modification. As the selection/generation mechanism is only partially known, the setting is of incomplete information. Since the publisher may keep improving the content once she receives feedback from the system, we argue that the game should be treated as a repeated game. Figures <a href="#fig3">3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a> present schematic illustrations of the resulting games for search systems and chat-like systems, respectively.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" id="fig3"> <figure> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-content-promotion-agent-design/search-schema-nbg.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Schematic illustration of a traditional search game"/> <figcaption class="caption text-center" style="color: inherit;"> <strong>Figure 3:</strong> Schematic illustration of a traditional search game. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" id="fig4"> <figure> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-content-promotion-agent-design/chat-schema-nbg.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Schematic illustration of a chat-like game"/> <figcaption class="caption text-center" style="color: inherit;"> <strong>Figure 4:</strong> Schematic illustration of a chat-like game. </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The viewpoint just presented is aligned with a growing body of research that treats content promotion as a strategic process. During recent years, several works have applied game-theoretic approaches to model competitive search <d-cite key="kurland_competitive_2022"></d-cite>, diversity-based ranking <d-cite key="mordo_ameliorating_2025"></d-cite>, to study the convergence of long term behavior to equilibrium in retrieval settings <d-cite key="madmon_search_2024, madmon_convergence_2024"></d-cite> and to design equilibrium in ranking games using corpus enrichment <d-cite key="nachimovsky_power_2025"></d-cite>. <d-cite key="ye_llm_empowered_2025"></d-cite> explored strategic document modifications in response to ranking feedback, revealing rich and sometimes counterintuitive dynamics. Yao et al.’s work provides deep, game-theoretic insight into how creators behave strategically in recommender systems and offers actionable designs for systems to align creator incentives with user welfare <d-cite key="yao_how_2023, yao_user_2024, yao_human_2024"></d-cite>. In the context of strategic retrieval systems, <d-cite key="mordo_sponsored_2024"></d-cite> presented the first formal game-theoretic analysis of a sponsored QA system where advertisers bid to have their sponsored content fused in the generated answer of question-answering systems. <d-cite key="mordo_sponsored_2024"></d-cite> showed how this new ad-integration model introduces strategic bidding behavior and derived equilibrium properties and welfare implications in this setting.</p> <p>However, the technological transformation of the last few years — particularly the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces — calls for re-examination and adaptation of the assumptions in classical game theoretic models. Traditional work often assumes fixed ranking functions and explicit publishers’ incentives. In contrast, chat-like systems generate personalized and dynamic answers <d-cite key="metzler_rethinking_2021"></d-cite>; the objective of publishers becomes much harder to define. These shifts motivate the development of new models that account for generative selection mechanisms, opaque feedback, and high adaptivity — all of which strengthen the case for game-theoretic reasoning and for new solution concepts.</p> <h2 id="agent-design-aspects-for-traditional-search-and-chat-like-systems">Agent Design Aspects for Traditional Search and Chat-like Systems</h2> <p>We delve into three important aspects that should be considered when designing agents that assist publishers promote their content.</p> <p>The first ingredient that can (and will) be naturally used, is to exploit the significant power of LLMs, e.g., use clever prompt engineering to promote content and maintain faithfulness in such games.</p> <p>A second ingredient one should be aware of is incomplete information about the selection or generation mechanism applied by the system. Using, for example, information about the decision made by the mechanism (e.g., past responses) can help to train and fine tune agents.</p> <p>The third ingredient is the need to be aware of competitors’ behavior. With limited access to annotated data — and only partial observability of the decisions made by these systems — this calls for carefully designed simulation tools. here again LLMs can be used as effective generative tools.</p> <p>Heretofore, we have described content promotion as a publishers game, shaped by evolving search and chat-based ecosystems and by the increasing role of generative AI. We now discuss different frameworks that can be employed to model and design effective agents in such settings.</p> <h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2> <h3 id="multi-agent-reinforcement-learning-marl">Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)</h3> <p>This framework models each player as an autonomous learning agent that optimizes its policy through repeated interaction with the environment and with other agents. MARL enables us to study how strategic behaviors emerge end-to-end from experience, without imposing strong assumptions about how these systems (i.e., search or chat-like systems) operate internally <d-cite key="gemp_developing_2022, guo_large_2024, shoham_if_2025, zhou_multi_agent_2025"></d-cite>. It also allows us to analyze coordination, competition, and non- stationarity — core properties of competitive games under a principled RL formulation. In our setting, the policy of the agent is the LLM itself, and reinforcement learning is the mechanism that aligns this LLM to the objectives of the game, given whatever information the agent can observe; different RL alignment algorithms may be adopted; e.g., <d-cite key="schulman_proximal_2017, rafailov_direct_2024, calandriello_multi-turn_2024, zhou_wpo_2024, shao_deepseekmath_2024"></d-cite>. If we had access to a full log of games — for example, historical queries and the ranking of pages in traditional search, or user questions and the resulting responses in chat-like systems — then we could directly formulate a supervised or RL-based learning problem. With such logs, the agent could be trained to optimize performance with respect to well-defined metrics (e.g., rank position, click-through, user engagement, rejection rates, etc.). Beyond the standard trade-offs encountered in reinforcement learning, our settings introduce unique design tensions that must be addressed:</p> <h4 id="a-short-term-wins-vs-long-term-information-leakage">(a) Short-term wins vs. long-term information leakage</h4> <p>An agent may be able to win an individual round of a game by aggressively optimizing its content. However, doing so may reveal its strategy to competing agents, enabling them to quickly imitate <d-cite key="raifer_information_2017"></d-cite> or counter it. Since the objective is to maximize cumulative reward across many rounds, the agent must balance immediate gains with strategic opacity — sometimes deliberately avoiding overly distinctive or extreme actions to prevent being copied <d-cite key="aumann_repeated_1995"></d-cite>.</p> <h4 id="b-on-policy-vs-off-policy-training">(b) On-policy vs. off-policy training</h4> <p>A crucial design question is whether the agent should continue learning during the game (on-policy) or rely solely on offline training before the game begins (off-policy).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Online adaptation</strong> allows the agent to track shifting competitor behaviors or evolving ranking/generation mechanisms.</li> <li><strong>Offline training</strong> offers stability and avoids overfitting to short-term noise or adversarial manipulations. Choosing between online and offline modes — or combining them — depends on the environment’s stability, observability, and the computational budget during gameplay.</li> </ul> <h4 id="c-constructing-the-loss-function">(c) Constructing the loss function</h4> <p>A core challenge is designing a loss function that balances ranking promotion or content visibility with faithfulness to the original content. On one hand, the agent should modify content to improve performance; on the other hand, excessive deviation risks harming credibility, violating constraints, or triggering penalties. The loss function must encode this balance explicitly — penalizing harmful drift while incentivizing strategic, beneficial content modifications.</p> <h3 id="synthetic-dataset-generation">Synthetic Dataset Generation</h3> <p>Sometimes real-world data presents substantial limitations: it may be inaccessible, noisy, incomplete, or simply ill-suited for the specific questions we wish to study. For this reason, we propose constructing synthetic datasets with controlled statistical properties. Synthetic data enables us to systematically probe targeted hypotheses — for example, how diversity constraints, noise structure, or shifts in the query or question distribution influence agent behavior and system-level outcomes. Moreover, synthetic datasets provide repeatability and experimental control that are often impossible with logs of production systems. They allow for clean ablation studies, controlled perturbations, and the isolation of causal factors, all of which are essential for understanding and improving agents operating in competitive ranking and chat-like ecosystems. Importantly LLMs now make it feasible to generate high-fidelity synthetic datasets at scale, enabling richer and more flexible experimental environments than were previously possible.</p> <h3 id="simulation-environment">Simulation Environment</h3> <p>A simulation environment that models the rules of the game, the ranking or generation function, and the interaction protocol between agents is essential in the discussed strategic ecosystems <d-cite key="kovarik_game_2024"></d-cite>. Such simulation can be used for generating strategic synthetic training datasets and for evaluating agents under diverse conditions. Together with the increasing proliferation over the Web of generated AI content <d-cite key="spennemann_delving_2025"></d-cite>, we suggest using simulators of the discussed competitions. Such simulators support rapid iteration and controlled experimentation across a wide range of configurations — rankers, prompts, datasets, reward structures, and hyperparameters. By isolating specific components of the system, the simulation environment helps uncover causal relationships, identify sensitivities to design choices, and systematically analyze how agents behave under different competitive scenarios.</p> <h3 id="self-play">Self-Play</h3> <p>Self-play is a method for iteratively training agents to be improved by competing (via simulation) against evolving versions of themselves <d-cite key="fang_serl_2025, fu_improving_2023, zhang_survey_2025"></d-cite>. This approach is particularly useful in settings where optimal strategies are not known a priori and where the competitive landscape shifts over time. Self-play helps uncover equilibrium behaviors, stability properties, and potential failure modes of learning algorithms in adversarial or co-adaptive settings.</p> <h3 id="meta-games-and-learning-equilibrium">Meta Games and Learning Equilibrium</h3> <p>Agent design itself introduces an additional strategic layer: designers may choose between different LLM architectures, training procedures, datasets, prompting strategies, or RL frameworks. In this broader perspective, agents are not only competing within a single ranking or generation game, but the designers are competing in a meta-game over agent designs <d-cite key="li_meta_game_2024, nachimovsky_multi_agent_2025, shapira_glee_2025"></d-cite>. Long-run success therefore depends on performing well not only within the fixed game, but also across the distribution of possible design choices made by other participants. In such meta-games, no single deterministic design may be universally optimal.</p> <p>Instead, probabilistic ensembles of designs — mixtures over algorithms, prompting strategies, or training regimes — may provide better robustness and theoretical guarantees. These ensemble-based strategies reduce exploitability, adapt better to heterogeneous opponents, and align with classical results in game theory showing that mixed strategies often outperform pure ones in competitive environments.</p> <p>Within meta-games over agent designs, a natural solution concept is learning equilibrium <d-cite key="monderer_learning_2007"></d-cite>. Rather than focusing on equilibria of the underlying content-generation game — where actions correspond to the content produced — learning equilibrium concerns the design algorithms themselves being in equilibrium. That is, each designer’s strategy for constructing agents is optimal given the strategies of other designers, forming a stable configuration at the meta-level.</p> <p>This distinction is subtle but important: learning equilibrium ensures that agent designs collectively converge to a stable distribution, even as the content-generation game continues to evolve. Such a concept becomes particularly relevant in scenarios where a platform or cloud provider offers content-generation services to multiple competing parties. In this setting, providing agent designs that satisfy learning equilibrium naturally mitigates exploitability, promotes fairness, and guarantees robust performance across heterogeneous competitors.</p> <h2 id="preliminary-results">Preliminary Results</h2> <p>We now turn to discuss several papers that illustrate components (or the absence thereof) of the frameworks discussed above.</p> <h3 id="prompt-based-agent">Prompt-based Agent</h3> <p> <d-cite key="bardas_automatic_2025"></d-cite> introduced a set of prompt-based agents designed to modify a human-authored document so that the updated version is ranked higher in the next round of the ranking. Their prompting strategy explicitly constrains the agent to produce revisions that remain faithful — at least to some extent — to the original document. <d-cite key="bardas_automatic_2025"></d-cite> introduced prompt- engineering techniques that, in an offline evaluation, outperformed human-authored documents without requiring any learning. Their evaluation was conducted using data from a ranking competition previously organized among human document authors.</p> <h3 id="rlrf-based-agent">RLRF-based Agent</h3> <p> <d-cite key="mordo_rlrf_2025"></d-cite> proposed a ranker-aligned agent, trained via a reinforcement- learning-from-ranker-feedback (RLRF) framework. They constructed a synthetic dataset generated through a simulated ranking competition and used it to train the agent with the DPO algorithm <d-cite key="rafailov_direct_2024"></d-cite>. Notably, the resulting agent learned to adapt both to the ranking mechanism and to the behavior of competing agents. Their simulation-based evaluation demonstrates robustness with respect to various environmental conditions, including the number of competitors and the choice of ranking function. The simulation assumed that the competing agents are nonoptimized agents; this setup can be viewed as a variant of self-play, where agents iteratively interact under stable, nonlearning strategies.</p> <h3 id="lemss">LEMSS</h3> <p> <d-cite key="mordo_lemss_2025" block=""></d-cite> also introduced LEMSS, a large-scale simulation framework for ranking competitions among LLM-based agents. Their results show that LLM-driven agents exhibit behavioral patterns like those of humans in iterative ranking games. LEMSS provides fine-grained control over nearly all aspects of the competition — such as the number of competitors, the ranking mechanism, and the reward structure — and enables comprehensive analysis of the induced repeated game. The simulation models a traditional ranking competition. To design agents capable of promoting content in a chat-like interaction setting, a simulation of such a mechanism is called for.</p> <h3 id="attacking-rag-based-systems">Attacking RAG-based systems</h3> <p>Recent work highlights the growing vulnerability of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to targeted manipulation. PoisonedRAG <d-cite key="zou_poisonedrag_2024"></d-cite> shows that inserting only a few malicious documents into a RAG system’s knowledge base can steer model outputs with high success, revealing a potent “knowledge-corruption” attack surface. In contrast, RIPRAG <d-cite key="xi_riprag_2025"></d-cite> use reinforcement learning to craft effective poisoned documents without access to the system’s internals. <d-cite key="wu_what_2025"></d-cite> suggests to cooperatively optimize content for generative search engines by learning their preference rules. However, all these papers overlook the competitive nature of real-world environments, where multiple strategic content creators adaptively improve their content — potentially using agents — in a repeated game. This missing game-theoretic perspective limits their ability to capture the dynamics and equilibria that emerge when many actors simultaneously attempt to influence RAG- based systems.</p> <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2> <p>Designing agents for ranking and content promotion competition benefits from a growing ecosystem of LLM-oriented development tools. Copilot Studio, Vertex AI, and LangChain provide the infrastructure needed to orchestrate complex LLM workflows, connect models to external data, and manage iterative agent-environment interactions. Copilot Studio enables rapid prototyping of agent behaviors within controlled interfaces, while Vertex AI offers scalable model hosting, fine-tuning, and evaluation pipelines suited for experimentation at scale. LangChain adds modular abstractions — such as memory, tools, retrieval, and multi- step reasoning — that make it easier to construct agents capable of interacting with dynamic environments. In addition, there are many python packages that may help to design and simulate RL-based agents such as <d-cite key="feng_agile_2024, liu_agentlite_2024"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In this blog post, we discussed how LLMs are reshaping the search ecosystem — both in traditional search and in emerging chat-like question-answering systems. Beyond transforming how users search, LLMs also change how publishers operate, enabling them to leverage LLMs to strategically optimize and promote iteratively their content.</p> <p>We discussed several frameworks for modelling and designing such agents, including game- theoretic models and reinforcement learning approaches. These frameworks help account for multiple layers of uncertainty: the opaque ranking model or response-generation mechanisms of retrieval systems, the dynamic nature of evolving user queries/questions, and the competitive behavior of other strategic publishers or human content creators.</p> <p>To build robust and adaptable agents, we emphasized that simulation plays a crucial role. Simulations enable the creation of strategic synthetic datasets and provide controlled environments for evaluating agent behavior, stress-testing policy robustness, and studying long-term dynamics in repeated competitive scenarios.</p> <p>Overall, as the ecosystem continues to evolve, combining insights from game theory, reinforcement learning, and simulation offers a principled path toward designing agents capable of succeeding in both current and future search paradigms.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the rise of LLMs, publishers now operate in a dual world where traditional search and chat-like systems coexist.

Let \(\mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{conv}}_{G}\) be the class of <strong>translation-equivariant, finite-support Toeplitz operators</strong> (U-Net convolutional kernels) and \(\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{attn}}\) the class of <strong>self-attention kernels with relative positional structure</strong> (DiTs).

This inclusion explains the empirical shift under modern hardware and datasets: attention strictly generalizes convolution while retaining it as an efficient special case, delivering smoother scaling laws and higher semantic “bandwidth” per denoising step. In practice, this is also a story of hardware path dependence: attention’s dense-matrix primitives align with contemporary accelerators and compiler stacks, effectively “winning” the hardware lottery <d-cite key="hookerHardwareLottery2021"></d-cite>. And, echoing the Bitter Lesson<d-cite key="richsuttonBitterLesson2019"></d-cite>, as data and compute grow, general methods with fewer hand-engineered priors dominate—making attention’s strict generalization of convolution the natural backbone at scale.</p> <h2 id="further-discussion">Further Discussion</h2> <h3 id="from-text-to-image-generation-to-real-world-applications">From Text-to-Image Generation to Real-World Applications</h3> <p>Text-to-image is now genuinely strong; the next wave is about <strong>conditioning existing pixels</strong> rather than generating from scratch—turning models into reliable editors that honor what must stay and change only what’s asked. This means prioritizing downstream tasks like image editing, inpainting/outpainting, image-to-image restyling, and structure- or reference-guided synthesis (edges, depth, layout, style, identity).

Autoregressive models like DALL-E <d-cite key="rameshZeroShotTexttoImageGeneration2021"></d-cite>, CogView <d-cite key="dingCogViewMasteringTexttoImage2021"></d-cite>, and CogView2 <d-cite key="dingCogView2FasterBetter2022"></d-cite> treat image generation as a sequence modeling problem, encoding images into discrete tokens using VQ-VAE <d-cite key="esserTamingTransformersHighResolution2021"></d-cite> or similar vector quantization methods, then autoregressively predicting the next token given previous tokens. This approach offers sequential generation with precise control and natural language integration, but suffers from slow generation, error accumulation, and discrete representation loss. In contrast, diffusion models operate directly on continuous pixel or latent representations, learning to reverse a gradual noise corruption process, which enables parallel generation, high-quality outputs, and flexible conditioning, though at the cost of computational overhead and less direct control. Recent advances have significantly improved autoregressive approaches: VAR <d-cite key="tianVisualAutoregressiveModeling2024"></d-cite> redefines autoregressive learning as coarse-to-fine “next-scale prediction” and achieves superior performance compared to diffusion transformers, while Infinity <d-cite key="hanInfinityScalingBitwise2025"></d-cite> demonstrates effective scaling of bitwise autoregressive modeling for high-resolution synthesis. Additionally, MAR <d-cite key="liAutoregressiveImageGeneration2024a"></d-cite> bridges the gap between paradigms by adopting diffusion loss for autoregressive models, enabling continuous-valued autoregressive generation without vector quantization. Recent work has also explored hybrid approaches that combine both paradigms: HunyuanImage 3.0 <d-cite key="caoHunyuanImage30Technical2025"></d-cite> and BLIP3-o <d-cite key="chenBLIP3oFamilyFully2025"></d-cite> demonstrate unified multimodal models within autoregressive frameworks while incorporating diffusion-inspired techniques, while OmniGen <d-cite key="xiaoOmniGenUnifiedImage2024"></d-cite> and OmniGen2 <d-cite key="wuOmniGen2ExplorationAdvanced2025"></d-cite> use diffusion models as backbones for unified generation capabilities.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog post’s knowledge cutoff is November 17, 2025.

Background</h2> <p>Inverse problems aim to recover an unknown signal \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) from indirect and noisy measurements \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m\). A large class of problems in imaging, signal processing, and computational physics can be written—at least approximately—as a linear–Gaussian observation model</p> \[\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n}, \qquad \mathbf{n} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \mathbf{I})\tag{1.1}\label{eq:ip},\] <p>where \(\mathbf{A}\) encodes the physics or geometry of the measurement process (e.g., convolution with a blur kernel, subsampled Fourier transform, Radon transform), and \(\mathbf{n}\) models sensor noise and modeling errors. The fundamental difficulty is that many such problems are <strong>ill-posed</strong>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Non-uniqueness:</strong> if \(\mathbf{A}\) is rank-deficient or severely underdetermined, many different \(\mathbf{x}\) produce the same \(\mathbf{y}\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Instability:</strong> when \(\mathbf{A}\) is ill-conditioned, small perturbations in \(\mathbf{y}\) can cause large changes in the reconstructed \(\mathbf{x}\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>If we ignore prior knowledge and rely solely on the measurements to solve via maximum likelihood estimation</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MLE}} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{x}} \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2,\] <p>it yields the solution either does not exist, is not unique, or is extremely sensitive to noise. This motivates <strong>regularization</strong>: we bias the solution toward signals that are “plausible” under our prior knowledge. In probabilistic form, this leads to <strong>Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)</strong> estimation</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{x}} \left[ \underbrace{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2}_{\text{Data Consistency}} \quad + \underbrace{\lambda R(\mathbf{x})}_{\text{Prior / Regularization}} \right],\] <p>where \(R(\mathbf{x})\) is a regularizer encoding the prior, and \(\lambda &gt; 0\) controls the trade-off between data fidelity and prior strength.</p> <p>From this perspective, the history of solving inverse problems is essentially the history of designing better functions for $R(\mathbf{x})$ — from handcrafted mathematical assumptions to data-driven generative manifolds.</p> <h3 id="11-handcrafted-analytical-priors">1.1. Handcrafted Analytical Priors</h3> <p>Before the era of deep learning, priors were designed based on mathematical and statistical intuition about natural signals.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Smoothness priors (Tikhonov / Gaussian):</strong><br/> Assuming that \(\mathbf{x}\) varies smoothly, one uses \(R(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{L}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2\) for some differential or finite-difference operator \(\mathbf{L}\). This corresponds to a Gaussian prior and leads to classical Tikhonov regularization <d-cite key="tikhonov1977solutions"></d-cite>. Such priors are stable and convex, but they oversmooth edges and cannot hallucinate missing high-frequency details.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Total Variation (TV) and piecewise-smooth priors:</strong><br/> To better preserve edges, TV replaces the quadratic penalty with an \(\ell_1\)-type penalty on gradients, e.g., \(R(\mathbf{x}) = \|\nabla \mathbf{x}\|_1.\) TV assumes that images are mostly smooth with sparse sharp transitions, which works well for piecewise-constant structures but can introduce “staircase” artifacts and still struggles with fine textures.<d-cite key="rudin1992nonlinear"></d-cite></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sparsity priors (wavelets, dictionary learning):</strong><br/> Another line of work assumes that \(\mathbf{x}\) is sparse in a suitable transform domain, such as wavelets or learned dictionaries, leading to penalties like \(R(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x}\|_1,\) where \(\mathbf{W}\) is a fixed or learned transform. These priors capture certain classes of textures and edges, but still act as <strong>handcrafted surrogates</strong> for the true (and highly complex) distribution of natural signals.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All of these classical priors are <strong>analytical</strong>: they are given by explicit formulas chosen by the designer. They are computationally convenient and theoretically well understood, but ultimately limited in expressiveness. They can discourage obviously “bad” solutions, yet they do not truly know what realistic images look like.</p> <h3 id="12-explicit-generative-manifolds">1.2. Explicit Generative Manifolds</h3> <p>With the rise of deep generative models, we no longer had to <strong>guess</strong> analytical forms for \(R(\mathbf{x})\). Instead, we could <strong>learn</strong> the data distribution directly from examples, and then use that model as a prior.</p> <p>A common idea is the <strong>manifold constraint</strong>: assume that plausible signals lie near the range of a generator \(G(\mathbf{z})\), where \(\mathbf{z}\) is a low-dimensional latent code. Rather than optimizing directly over \(\mathbf{x}\), we optimize over \(\mathbf{z}\):</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{z}} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{z}} \left[ \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A}(G(\mathbf{z}))\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\mathbf{z}\|_2^2 \right], \qquad \hat{\mathbf{x}} = G(\hat{\mathbf{z}}).\] <p>Different generative models instantiate this idea in different ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>GANs <d-cite key="goodfellow2014generative"></d-cite>:</strong> Adversarial training yields highly realistic samples and sharp details. However, mode collapse and training instability make the learned manifold incomplete: if the ground-truth \(\mathbf{x}\) is not well covered by the generator, optimization in \(\mathbf{z}\) may fail or converge to a visually plausible but incorrect solution.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>VAEs <d-cite key="kingma2013auto"></d-cite>:</strong> VAEs provide a probabilistic decoder \(p_\theta(\mathbf{x}\mid \mathbf{z})\) with a simple prior on \(\mathbf{z}\) (often Gaussian). Their reconstructions are typically smoother and more stable than GANs but tend to be <strong>blurry</strong>, reflecting the ELBO objective’s tendency to average over modes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normalizing Flows <d-cite key="dinh2016density,kingma2018glow"></d-cite> and related models:</strong> Flows provide exact likelihoods and invertible mappings, so in principle they offer a very clean way to define \(p(\mathbf{x})\). In practice, however, they impose architectural constraints (e.g., invertibility and tractable Jacobians), and solving inverse problems with them often requires expensive Jacobian–vector products or MCMC steps.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In all these cases, the prior is no longer an explicit penalty \(R(\mathbf{x})\) but an <strong>implicit manifold</strong> traced out by a neural generator. This brings much richer structure but also introduces new optimization and modeling challenges: enforcing measurement consistency while staying on (or near) the learned manifold is nontrivial.</p> <h3 id="13-the-shift-to-diffusion-prior">1.3. The Shift to Diffusion Prior</h3> <p>Both previous families of priors have clear trade-offs:</p> <ul> <li>Classical analytical priors are <strong>stable, convex, and easy to optimize</strong>, but they are too simple to faithfully model complex natural images.</li> <li>Explicit generative manifolds are <strong>expressive</strong> and can synthesize highly realistic samples, but they are often <strong>hard to optimize against</strong> and can be brittle outside the training distribution.</li> </ul> <p>Diffusion models <d-cite key="ho2020denoising,song2020score"></d-cite> offer a different compromise. Instead of defining a single deterministic manifold or a closed-form regularizer, they define a <strong>stochastic generative process</strong> that gradually transforms simple noise into data through a sequence of Gaussian denoising steps. Conceptually, they give us:</p> <ul> <li>A powerful, flexible <strong>prior over signals</strong>, encoded by a learned score or denoiser.</li> <li>A natural way to <strong>interleave prior-driven denoising with measurement-driven corrections</strong> along the sampling trajectory.</li> </ul> <p>This “dynamic” view of the prior—where we guide a stochastic or deterministic trajectory through noisy space—makes diffusion models particularly attractive for inverse problems. It allows us to inject measurement information <strong>gradually</strong>, to decouple a pretrained diffusion prior from the forward operator \(\mathbf{A}\), and to design algorithms that behave more like <strong>operator-splitting schemes</strong> than hard manifold projection. The rest of this post develops this perspective in detail.</p> <h2 id="2-diffusion-priors-for-inverse-problems">2. Diffusion priors for inverse problems</h2> <p>In the background section we framed inverse problems as Bayesian inference with a prior over clean signals \(\mathbf{x}_0\) and a likelihood induced by the forward operator \(\mathbf{A}\). With a diffusion model, this prior is no longer given by an explicit energy \(R(\mathbf{x}_0)\) or a simple manifold parameterization \(G(\mathbf{z})\). Instead, it is encoded in a <strong>stochastic generative process</strong> that gradually transforms Gaussian noise into data. This section explains how that process works and why it makes inverse problems both powerful and subtle.</p> <h3 id="21-bayesian-gold-standard-with-a-diffusion-prior">2.1. Bayesian “gold standard” with a diffusion prior</h3> <p>Consider again the inverse problem where the measurement is generated from a forward model \(\mathbf{y} \sim p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0),\) with \(\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p(\mathbf{x}_0)\) given by a diffusion prior. In the simplest case we assume additive Gaussian noise (Eq. \eqref{eq:ip}), so that</p> \[p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0) \propto \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0\|_2^2\Big).\] <p>By Bayes’ rule, the posterior over clean signals is</p> \[p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{y}) \;\propto\; p(\mathbf{y}\mid\mathbf{x}_0)\,p(\mathbf{x}_0).\] <p>If we could evaluate \(\log p(\mathbf{x}_0)\) and its gradient exactly, the <strong>Bayesian gold standard</strong> would be the MAP estimator</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\max_{\mathbf{x}_0} \left[ \underbrace{\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0)}_{\text{Data fidelity}} + \underbrace{\log p(\mathbf{x}_0)}_{\text{Prior}} \right]. \tag{2.1}\label{eq:obj}\] <p>Conceptually this is straightforward: we simply trade off how well \(\mathbf{x}_0\) explains the measurement \(\mathbf{y}\) versus how plausible \(\mathbf{x}_0\) is under the diffusion prior. In practice, diffusion models make this optimization non-trivial, because the prior is not defined directly in the clean space \(\mathbf{x}_0\).</p> <h3 id="22-diffusion-models-live-in-noisy-space">2.2. Diffusion models live in noisy space</h3> <p>A modern diffusion model is trained in a <strong>noisy</strong> space. One common continuous-time formulation uses a forward SDE</p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,dt + g(t)\,d\mathbf{w}_t, \qquad t\in[0,1],\] <p>where \(\mathbf{x}_0\) is a clean data sample, \(\mathbf{x}_1\) is approximately Gaussian noise, and \(\mathbf{w}_t\) is standard Brownian motion. The forward SDE defines a family of intermediate marginals \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) that smoothly interpolate between the data distribution at \(t=0\) and a simple reference (typically Gaussian) at \(t=1\). Training learns a <strong>score network</strong></p> \[s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t) \approx \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t),\] <p>i.e., a vector field that points in the direction of steeper log-density at each noise level. Geometrically, the score pushes samples uphill towards regions of higher probability. At generation time, we can run the <strong>reverse-time SDE</strong> <d-cite key="anderson1982reverse"></d-cite></p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = \Big[f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) - g^2(t)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\Big]\,dt + g(t)\,d\bar{\mathbf{w}}_t,\] <p>from \(t=1\) (pure noise) to \(t=0\) (clean data), where \(\bar{\mathbf{w}}_t\) is a standard Brownian motion in reversed time. Alternatively, Song et al. <d-cite key="song2020score"></d-cite> showed that there exists a deterministic <strong>probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE)</strong></p> \[\frac{d\mathbf{x}_t}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\,\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t),\] <p>whose solution curves share the same marginals \(\{p_t\}_{t\in[0,1]}\) as the stochastic SDE. Intuitively, the SDE adds randomness while the ODE simply transports probability mass along the same flow.</p> <p>Crucially, all of these objects – the forward SDE, the reverse SDE, and the PF-ODE – are defined in terms of the <strong>noisy</strong> variables \(\mathbf{x}_t\) and their densities \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\). The prior \(p(\mathbf{x}_0)\) only appears implicitly as the marginal at time zero of this process. This creates a mismatch for inverse problems:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The likelihood \(p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0)\) in Eq. \eqref{eq:obj} is naturally written in the <strong>clean space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_0\).</p> </li> <li> <p>The diffusion prior is only directly accessible through scores \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) in the <strong>noisy space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_t\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>The rest of this blogpost can be read as a sequence of techniques for bridging this gap: how to couple measurement information with a prior that lives along a diffusion trajectory.</p> <h3 id="23-tweedies-estimator-as-a-clean-space-anchor">2.3. Tweedie’s estimator as a clean-space anchor</h3> <p>A key tool for connecting noisy and clean spaces is <strong>Tweedie’s formula</strong>. In the simplest (and widely used) setting, the forward diffusion at time \(t\) can be written as</p> \[\mathbf{x}_t = \alpha(t)\,\mathbf{x}_0 + \sigma(t)\,\boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \qquad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}),\] <p>where \(\alpha(t)\) and \(\sigma(t)\) are scalar functions that control the signal and noise levels. Under this Gaussian corruption model, Tweedie’s formula tells us that the posterior mean of the clean signal given a noisy observation \(\mathbf{x}_t\) is</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t) \;=\; \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}_0\mid\mathbf{x}_t] \;=\; \frac{\mathbf{x}_t + \sigma^2(t)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)}{\alpha(t)}.\] <p>Here \(s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t) \approx \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) is the score learned by the diffusion model. Thus, once the diffusion prior is trained, we can <em>decode</em> any noisy point \(\mathbf{x}_t\) into a corresponding <strong>clean-space estimate</strong> \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) using only the score network.</p> <p>From a statistical perspective, \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) is the <strong>minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)</strong> estimator of \(\mathbf{x}_0\) given \(\mathbf{x}_t\): among all possible functions of \(\mathbf{x}_t\), it minimizes the expected squared error</p> \[\mathbb{E}\big[\|\mathbf{x}_0 - \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\|_2^2\big].\] <p>It is therefore a principled, Bayes-optimal representative of the posterior distribution over \(\mathbf{x}_0\) for that particular noise level. From a geometric perspective, we can interpret \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) as a kind of <strong>clean-space anchor</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Let \(M_0\) denote the (unknown) data manifold where the diffusion prior assigns high density at \(t=0\).</li> <li>For a noisy point \(\mathbf{x}_t\), the posterior over \(\mathbf{x}_0\) given \(\mathbf{x}_t\) is typically concentrated near a small region on or near \(M_0\).</li> <li>Tweedie’s estimator \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) sits near the <em>center of mass</em> of that posterior cloud.

Why Inverse Problems Can Be Solved by Sampling</h3> <p>We first revisit why <strong>sampling</strong> from a suitable reverse-time process solves not only the unconditional generative problem, but also the <strong>inverse problem</strong>.</p> <p>We begin with the <strong>unconditional</strong> case. Let \(\{ \mathbf{x}_t \}_{t\in[0,T]}\) be a trajectory followed by the forward diffusion SDE,</p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,dt + g(t)\,d\mathbf{w}_t,\qquad \mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_{\text{data}},\] <p>with marginal densities \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\). These densities satisfy the <strong>Fokker–Planck equation</strong></p> \[\partial_t p_t(\mathbf{x}_t) = -\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\!\cdot\!\big(f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\big) +\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}^2\!\big(g^2(t)\,p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\big).\] <p>Song et al. <d-cite key="song2020score,anderson1982reverse"></d-cite> showed that there exists both a <strong>reverse-time SDE</strong> and an equivalent <strong>PF-ODE</strong> whose marginals evolve backward in time but follow the <strong>same</strong> family of densities \(\{p_t\}\). In particular, the PF-ODE</p> \[\frac{d\mathbf{x}_t}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\,\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\] <p>satisfies the same Fokker–Planck equation as the forward SDE, but with time running from \(t=1\) back to \(t=0\). If we start from \(\mathbf{x}_1\sim p_1\approx\mathcal{N}(0,I)\) and integrate this PF-ODE with the <strong>true</strong> score, then \(\mathbf{x}_0\sim p_{\text{data}}\).</p> <p>Now, <strong>condition</strong> on a measurement \(\mathbf{y}\) produced by a forward model \(\mathbf{y}\sim p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0)\).</p> <p>Conditioning lifts to the <strong>entire diffusion trajectory</strong>: we obtain a posterior process \(\{\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y}\}\) with marginals \(p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\). Crucially, because conditioning does not change the forward SDE dynamics, the posterior densities satisfy the <strong>same Fokker–Planck operator</strong>, but with different initial and terminal marginals.</p> \[\partial_t p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y}) = -\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\!\cdot\!\big(f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\big) +\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}^2\!\big(g^2(t)\,p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\big),\] <p>By the same reasoning as in the unconditional case, there exists a <strong>posterior PF-ODE</strong></p> \[\frac{d\mathbf{x}_t}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) -\tfrac{1}{2}g^2(t)\,\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y}),\] <p>such that, if we start at \(t=1\) from \(\mathbf{x}_1\sim p(\mathbf{x}_1\mid \mathbf{y})\) (which is typically close to the unconditional \(p_1\)) and integrate backward, then the marginals follow \(\{p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\}_{t\in[0,1]}\), and in particular</p> \[\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{y}).\] <p>This gives the fundamental justification behind posterior-guided sampling:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p>If we can approximate the posterior score \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\) and integrate the corresponding PF-ODE, then solving the inverse problem reduces to sampling from this posterior-guided flow.</p> </aside> <p>The only missing piece is an approximation of the <strong>likelihood score</strong> \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_t)\) in Eq. \eqref{eq:posterior_score}, which we turn to next.</p> <h3 id="32-approximating-the-likelihood-score-via-the-clean-space">3.2. Approximating the Likelihood Score via the Clean Space</h3> <p>The decomposition in Eq. \eqref{eq:posterior_score} is conceptually simple:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>prior score</strong> \(s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) is directly provided by the diffusion prior.</li> <li>The challenging part is the <strong>likelihood score</strong>: \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_t)\).</li> </ul> <p>Under the standard linear–Gaussian measurement model, the likelihood is naturally defined in the <strong>clean space</strong>:</p> \[\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0) = -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0\|_2^2 + \text{const} \quad\Rightarrow\quad \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_0}\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\mathbf{A}^\top(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0).\] <p>However, the diffusion model operates in the <strong>noisy space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_t\), where the noisy-space likelihood is obtained by marginalizing over \(\mathbf{x}_0\):</p> \[p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_t) = \int p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0)\,p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{x}_t)\,d\mathbf{x}_0 = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}_0\sim p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{x}_t)}\big[p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0)\big].\] <p>This integral is intractable in high dimensions, and differentiating \(\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_t)\) w.r.t. \(\mathbf{x}_t\) would require full access to the conditional distribution \(p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{x}_t)\), which we only know implicitly through the score network.</p> <p>Posterior-guided methods therefore make a <strong>concentration assumption</strong>: for a given \((\mathbf{x}_t,t)\), the conditional distribution \(p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{x}_t)\) is sharply peaked around the Tweedie denoiser</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t) = \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{x}_t] = \frac{\mathbf{x}_t + \sigma^2(t)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)}{\alpha(t)}.\] <p>Approximating \(p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{x}_t)\) by a point mass at \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0\) (a delta / Laplace approximation) yields</p> \[p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_t) \approx p(\mathbf{y}\mid \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)) \quad\Rightarrow\quad \log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_t) \approx \log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)).\] <p>Differentiating this approximation with respect to \(\mathbf{x}_t\) and applying the chain rule gives</p> \[\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_t) = \Big(\frac{\partial \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0}{\partial \mathbf{x}_t}\Big)^\top \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_0}\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0) \Big|_{\mathbf{x}_0=\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)}. \tag{3.3}\label{eq:lik}\] <p>The likelihood score thus factorizes into:</p> <ol> <li> <p>a <strong>clean-space data-consistency gradient</strong> \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_0}\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0),\) computable in closed form for many forward models; and</p> </li> <li> <p>a <strong>Jacobian–vector product (JVP)</strong> involving the Tweedie denoiser \((\tfrac{\partial \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0}{\partial \mathbf{x}_t})^\top,\) which maps this clean-space gradient back into the noisy space.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Eq. \eqref{eq:lik} is the main technical bridge that connects the likelihood score in noisy space to a clean-space gradient plus a Jacobian term. In the next subsection we analyze what this Jacobian does geometrically.</p> <h3 id="33-the-jacobian-as-an-approximate-tangent-space-projector">3.3. The Jacobian as an approximate tangent-space projector</h3> <p>The key takeaway from Eq. \eqref{eq:lik} is that the Jacobian of the Tweedie denoiser does not act in an arbitrary way: under the standard “data lie near a smooth manifold” assumption and in the small-noise regime, it behaves <strong>approximately</strong> like a projection onto the tangent space of the data manifold. This is exactly what we want for inverse problems: the likelihood gradient should pull us <strong>along</strong> the manifold rather than pushing us off it.</p> <p>To make this precise, assume that clean data concentrate near a smooth $d_0$-dimensional manifold $M_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. For notational simplicity, work in local coordinates around some point $x^\star \in M_0$ and decompose any nearby point as</p> \[x_t = x^\star + u + n,\] <p>where $u \in T_{x^\star} M_0$ is the tangent component and $n \perp T_{x^\star} M_0$ is the normal component.</p> <p>In the small-noise regime with Gaussian corruption $x_t = x_0 + \sigma \varepsilon$, $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$, a standard manifold argument (see e.g. denoising-score literature) shows that the log-density of $x_t$ can be approximated as</p> \[\log p_t(x_t) \;\approx\; C(u) \;-\; \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\,\|n\|^2,\] <p>where $C(u)$ varies slowly along the manifold and the quadratic term penalizes distance in the normal direction. Consequently, the score is approximately</p> \[\nabla_{x_t} \log p_t(x_t) \;\approx\; -\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\,n,\] <p>i.e., it points back toward the manifold by cancelling the normal offset $n$. Plugging this into Tweedie’s formula,</p> \[\hat x_0(x_t,t) = x_t + \sigma^2 \nabla_{x_t} \log p_t(x_t),\] <p>we obtain, to first order,</p> \[\hat x_0(x_t,t) \;\approx\; x_t + \sigma^2\Big(-\frac{1}{\sigma^2} n\Big) = x_t - n = x^\star + u.\] <p>In other words, when the noise is small and the model is accurate, the Tweedie denoiser $\hat x_0(x_t,t)$ behaves like the <strong>nearest-point projection</strong> onto the data manifold:</p> \[\hat x_0(x_t,t) \;\approx\; \Pi(x_t) \;:=\; \arg\min_{z \in M_0} \|z - x_t\|_2^2.\] <p>For this nearest-point projection map $\Pi$, classical differential geometry tells us that its Jacobian at a point $x_t$ whose projection is $x^\star = \Pi(x_t)$ is the orthogonal projector onto the tangent space $T_{x^\star} M_0$:</p> \[D\Pi(x_t) = P_{T_{x^\star} M_0}.\] <p>Intuitively, a small perturbation $\delta x_t$ of the input decomposes into</p> \[\delta x_t = \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}} + \delta x_{\mathrm{nor}}, \quad \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}} \in T_{x^\star} M_0,\; \delta x_{\mathrm{nor}} \perp T_{x^\star} M_0.\] <p>Under the projection, the tangent component moves the projected point along the manifold, while the normal component is largely “forgotten”:</p> \[D\Pi(x_t)\,\delta x_t \;\approx\; \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}}.\] <p>Since Tweedie’s denoiser $\hat x_0(x_t,t)$ is, in the small-noise limit, a smooth perturbation of this nearest-point projection, its Jacobian $J_{\hat x_0}(x_t) = \partial \hat x_0 / \partial x_t$ inherits the same behavior:</p> \[J_{\hat x_0}(x_t)\,\delta x_t \;\approx\; \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}},\] <p>i.e., it <strong>keeps</strong> the tangent component and <strong>suppresses</strong> the normal component of any perturbation.</p> <p>Plugging this geometric picture back into Eq. \eqref{eq:lik}, we can reinterpret the likelihood score as</p> \[\nabla_{x_t}\log p(y \mid x_t) \;\approx\; \underbrace{J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)}_{\text{tangent-space projector}}\, \underbrace{\nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0)\big|_{x_0=\hat x_0(x_t,t)}}_{\text{clean-space DC gradient}}.\] <p>Geometrically:</p> <ol> <li> <p>We first compute a <strong>clean-space data-consistency gradient</strong></p> \[g_{x_0} = \nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} A^\top (y - A \hat x_0),\] <p>which tells us how to move $\hat x_0$ to better match the measurement.</p> </li> <li> <p>We then apply $J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)$, which approximately projects this gradient onto the tangent space $T_{\hat x_0} M_0$, removing its normal component.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The resulting likelihood score in noisy space moves $x_t$ in a direction that (i) improves data consistency because it originates from $g_{x_0}$, and (ii) remains compatible with the diffusion prior because its normal component has been suppressed. In this approximate sense, the Jacobian of Tweedie’s estimator acts as a <strong>tangent-space projector</strong> for likelihood guidance.</p> <h3 id="34-2d-toy-illustration">3.4. 2D Toy Illustration</h3> <p>To make the geometric effect of the Jacobian term more concrete, we visualize a toy 2D inverse problem where the clean data lie on a sine-shaped manifold \(M_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^2\). We fix a single target point \(x_0^\star \in M_0\) (red star) that is consistent with the measurement \(\mathbf{y}\), and start the reverse diffusion from a noisy point far away from the manifold. At each reverse-time step we consider three different update rules, corresponding to three panels in the animation.</p> <figure class="figure"> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-diffusion-inverse-problems/posterior_guided_sampling.gif" alt="Posterior-guided sampling: prior vs naive guidance vs Jacobian guidance" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; image-rendering: auto;"/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Animation 2: Clean-space local-MAP as a denoise–optimize–re-noise scheme. </div> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Prior-only dynamics (left).</strong> In the first panel we ignore the measurement and only follow the diffusion <strong>prior score</strong>. Geometrically, this score always pulls the current state \(x_t\) back towards the nearest point on the learned manifold \(M_0\). The trajectory (purple) quickly relaxes to some high-density region of the prior, but this point has no reason to satisfy the measurement. This corresponds to unconditional sampling: we solve the generative problem, not the inverse problem.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prior + naive guidance in noisy space (middle).</strong> In the second panel we add a <strong>naive likelihood guidance</strong> term directly in the ambient space, approximating the posterior score as</p> \[\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t \mid y) \;\approx\; s_\theta(x_t,t) \;+\; \underbrace{\nabla_{x_t} \log p(y \mid x_t)}_{\text{naive DC term}}.\] <p>The blue arrow shows the prior score \(s*\theta(x_t,t)\), which pulls \(x_t\) back to the manifold, while the orange arrow is the guidance vector pointing towards the target. Because this guidance is defined in the ambient space, it typically has a large normal component and <strong>pushes the trajectory off the manifold</strong>. As a result, the two forces frequently oppose each other (“guidance fights prior”), leading to zig-zag trajectories that cut across low-density regions and visibly leave \(M_0\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prior + Jacobian-guided likelihood (right).</strong> In the third panel we use the Tweedie denoiser \(\hat x_0(x_t,t)\) as a clean-space anchor, compute the <strong>clean-space measurement gradient</strong> \(\nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0)\) at \(x_0 = \hat x_0\), and then map it back to the noisy space via the Jacobian:</p> \[\nabla_{x_t}\log p(y \mid x_t) \;\approx\; J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)\, \nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0)\Big|_{x_0=\hat x_0(x_t,t)}.\] <p>As argued in the previous subsection, the Jacobian \(J_{\hat x_0}(x_t)\) behaves like a <strong>projection onto the tangent space</strong> \(T_{\hat x_0} M_0\). In the animation, this means the orange guidance arrow is no longer allowed to point arbitrarily into the ambient space: it is projected to lie <strong>along the manifold</strong>, while the blue prior score keeps \(x_t\) attached to \(M_0\). The resulting posterior-guided trajectory slides along the sine curve toward the target, achieving data consistency <em>without</em> drifting away from the learned generative manifold.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This toy example illustrates the core role of the Jacobian term in posterior-guided sampling: it converts a clean-space likelihood gradient into a noisy-space correction that is automatically constrained to the tangent space of the data manifold. In practice, this allows us to approximate the posterior score as</p> \[\nabla_{x_t}\log p(x_t \mid y) \;\approx\; s_\theta(x_t,t) \;+\; J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)\, \nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0),\] <p>so that the prior and likelihood contribute <strong>compatible</strong> vector fields—one keeps us on the manifold, the other moves us along it toward solutions that both match the measurements and remain realistic under the diffusion prior.</p> <h2 id="4-local-map-optimization-paradigm">4. Local-MAP optimization Paradigm</h2> <p>The posterior-guided sampling paradigm views inverse problems as a <strong>sampling task</strong>: we try to simulate a posterior diffusion process in noisy space and read off samples from $p(\mathbf{x}_0 \mid \mathbf{y})$ at $t = 0$. In this section we turn to a complementary viewpoint, exemplified by DDS <d-cite key="chung2023decomposed"></d-cite>, DDRM <d-cite key="kawar2022denoising"></d-cite>, DDNM <d-cite key="wang2022zero"></d-cite>, DiffusionMBIR <d-cite key="chung2023solving"></d-cite>, and more recent LMAPS methods <d-cite key="zhang2025local"></d-cite>, which instead treat inverse problems as a sequence of <strong>local optimization problems in the clean space</strong> $\mathbf{x}_0$.</p> <p>At a high level, these methods answer a different question:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p>Rather than asking “how should we move \(\mathbf{x}_t\) along the posterior vector field?”, we repeatedly ask : <strong>“given our current noisy state, which clean image best balances data fidelity and the diffusion prior, locally?”</strong></p> </aside> <p>With this in mind, each reverse step then consists of three conceptually separate operations:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Denoise to a clean-space anchor:</strong> map the current noisy point $\mathbf{x}_t$ to a Tweedie denoiser $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$, which serves as a local prior “anchor” in the clean space.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Local MAP refinement:</strong> around this anchor, solve a <strong>small MAP problem</strong> in $\mathbf{x}_0$ that trades off data consistency and proximity to $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0$.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Re-noising:</strong> re-inject the optimized solution into the diffusion trajectory by adding back the appropriate amount of noise.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Over the full reverse trajectory, this yields a <strong>denoise–optimize–re-noise</strong> scheme that gradually transports the initial noise towards a measurement-consistent and prior-plausible solution. As shown in Figure 2, starting from pure noise \(z = x_1\) at \(t=1\), the reverse process produces intermediate noisy states \(x_t, x_{t-1}, \dots\) in the noisy space.

From global MAP to local quadratic surrogates</h3> <p>Recall the global MAP objective from Eq. \eqref{eq:obj}:</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\max_{\mathbf{x}_0} \left[ \log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0) + \log p(\mathbf{x}_0)\right]. \tag{4.1}\label{eq:global_map}\] <p>Under the linear–Gaussian measurement model \(\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0 + \mathbf{n}\), the negative log-likelihood is a familiar quadratic:</p> \[-\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0) = \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0\|_2^2 + \text{const}.\] <p>The difficulty lies in the prior term \(-\log p(\mathbf{x}_0)\). For a diffusion prior, we do not have direct access to this function or its gradient in \(\mathbf{x}_0\)-space; all we can evaluate is the <strong>noisy-space score</strong> \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) along the diffusion trajectory.</p> <p>This is where the Tweedie estimator \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\), introduced in the previous section, becomes useful. For a fixed time \(t\) and noisy sample \(\mathbf{x}_t\), we can view</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t, t) = \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}_0 \mid \mathbf{x}_t]\] <p>as a <strong>local summary of the prior</strong>: it lives in a high-density neighborhood of the data manifold, and in the small-noise regime it behaves like a soft projection onto $M_0$. It is therefore natural to use $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0$ as the center of a <strong>local quadratic surrogate</strong> for $-\log p(\mathbf{x}_0)$,</p> \[-\log p(\mathbf{x}_0) \;\approx\; \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{x}_0 - \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\|_2^2 + \text{const},\] <p>which says “in a small neighborhood of $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0$, the prior behaves as if it were a Gaussian with mean $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0$ and unit covariance.”</p> <p>Substituting this approximation into Eq. \eqref{eq:global_map} and keeping the exact data term yields the <strong>local MAP objective</strong> at time $t$:</p> \[\mathbf{x}_0^\star(\mathbf{x}_t) \;\approx\; \arg\min_{\mathbf{x}_0} \underbrace{\frac{\gamma}{2}\|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0\|_2^2}_{\text{data consistency}} \;+\; \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{x}_0-\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\|_2^2}_{\text{local prior / trust-region term}}, \tag{4.2}\label{eq:local_map}\] <p>where $\gamma$ is a tunable parameter that absorbs $1/\sigma^2$ and possible rescalings of the prior term.</p> <p>The second term plays a dual role:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Local prior:</strong> it encodes the diffusion prior <strong>locally</strong> around $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0$;</li> <li><strong>Trust region:</strong> it keeps the optimizer from wandering too far away from the current clean-space anchor, ensuring that the Gaussian approximation of the prior remains valid.</li> </ul> <p>In other words, Eq. \eqref{eq:local_map} is a <strong>local, trust-region version</strong> of the global MAP problem \eqref{eq:global_map}, with the full diffusion prior replaced by a quadratic surrogate centered at $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)$.</p> <h3 id="42-denoiseoptimizere-noise-scheme">4.2. Denoise–optimize–re-noise scheme</h3> <p>Given the local objective \eqref{eq:local_map}, local-MAP-based algorithms build a reverse-time solver by repeating the following pattern at each time step $t_k$:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Denoise to obtain a clean-space anchor.</p> <p>Starting from the current noisy state $\mathbf{x}_{t_k}$, we first compute the Tweedie denoiser</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0^{(k)} = \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_{t_k}, t_k) = \frac{\mathbf{x}_{t_k} + \sigma^2(t_k)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t_k},t_k)}{\alpha(t_k)},\] <p>which serves as a <strong>clean-space anchor</strong> encoding the diffusion prior at time $t_k$. This step is identical to what we used in the posterior-guided sampling paradigm: Tweedie provides a statistically optimal estimate of the underlying clean image given the noisy observation $\mathbf{x}_{t_k}$.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Local MAP optimization in the clean space.</p> <p>Given $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0^{(k)}$, we now solve the local surrogate problem</p> \[\mathbf{x}_0^{(k)\,\star} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{x}_0} \frac{\gamma}{2}\|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0\|_2^2 + \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{x}_0-\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0^{(k)}\|_2^2. \tag{4.3}\label{eq:local_map_k}\] <p>For linear measurement operators $\mathbf{A}$, Eq. \eqref{eq:local_map_k} is a convex quadratic with a closed-form solution</p> \[\mathbf{x}_0^{(k)\,\star} = \left(\gamma\,\mathbf{A}^\top\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{I}\right)^{-1} \left(\gamma\,\mathbf{A}^\top\mathbf{y} + \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0^{(k)}\right),\] <p>but explicitly inverting the matrix is usually impractical. Instead, DDS <d-cite key="chung2023decomposed"></d-cite> and diffusion MBIR-style methods <d-cite key="chung2023solving"></d-cite> solve \eqref{eq:local_map_k} with <strong>iterative linear solvers</strong>, most notably <strong>conjugate gradients (CG)</strong>. This has two important consequences:</p> <ul> <li>The data-consistency structure (e.g., convolution, Fourier sampling, Radon transforms) can be exploited via fast operators $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A}^\top$, without ever forming $\mathbf{A}^\top\mathbf{A}$ explicitly.</li> <li>The local MAP update can be run for a small, fixed number of CG iterations, trading off accuracy for speed. In practice, a handful of CG steps per diffusion time step already yields strong reconstructions.</li> </ul> <p>Conceptually, this step is where <strong>classical inverse-problem machinery</strong> (quadratic data terms, Krylov solvers, proximal point iterations) interfaces with the <strong>diffusion prior</strong>. All prior information enters through the choice of $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0^{(k)}$; the rest of the computation is purely deterministic optimization in the clean space.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Re-noise the optimized solution back to $t_{k-1}$.</p> <p>Having obtained the locally optimal clean image $\mathbf{x}_0^{(k)\,\star}$ that balances measurement fit and closeness to the anchor, the final step is to <strong>inject it back into the diffusion trajectory</strong> by adding noise corresponding to the next time step.</p> <p>For a DDIM- or VE-/VP-style schedule, this can be written in the generic form</p> \[\mathbf{x}_{t_{k-1}} = \alpha(t_{k-1})\,\mathbf{x}_0^{(k)\,\star} + \sigma(t_{k-1})\,\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{t_{k}}, t_k),\] <p>possibly with additional deterministic or stochastic corrections depending on the chosen sampler. The key point is that <strong>the generative noise injection is now decoupled from the data-consistency optimization</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>The diffusion prior governs how we move between time steps via $(\alpha(t),\sigma(t))$ and the score network;</li> <li>The measurement model governs how we update $\mathbf{x}_0$ locally through Eq. \eqref{eq:local_map_k}.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h3 id="43-how-local-map-approximates-global-map">4.3. How local MAP approximates global MAP</h3> <p>So far we have only claimed that Eq. \eqref{eq:local_map} is a <strong>local surrogate</strong> to the global MAP objective \eqref{eq:global_map}. A natural question is: <strong>under what conditions does following these local updates approximate the true MAP solution?</strong></p> <p>Recent analyses under the umbrella of LMAPS <d-cite key="zhang2025local"></d-cite> provide the following picture:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Small time steps &amp; accurate Tweedie.</strong> If we use a fine time discretization and the Tweedie estimator is accurate (so that $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)$ stays in a tight neighborhood of the true posterior mean), then the quadratic surrogate in \eqref{eq:local_map} is a good approximation of $-\log p(\mathbf{x}_0)$ in that neighborhood.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Limited local movement per step.</strong> If the trust-region penalty $|\mathbf{x}_0-\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0|^2$ is sufficiently strong (or equivalently, if we do not over-iterate the local solver), then each update $\mathbf{x}_0^{(k),\star}$ remains close to $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0^{(k)}$, and the Gaussian approximation of the prior does not break down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Composition of local steps.</strong> As we move backward in time, the composition of these local MAP updates traces out a trajectory in the clean space that, in the continuous-time limit, can be shown to follow a <strong>gradient flow of the negative log-posterior</strong>. Intuitively, each local solve takes one small step in the direction of the global MAP solution, but expressed in the natural coordinates of the diffusion prior.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Under these assumptions, the final $\mathbf{x}_0$ returned by the denoise–optimize–re-noise scheme is a <strong>consistent approximation of the true MAP estimator</strong> in \eqref{eq:global_map}.</p> <h3 id="44-toy-illustration-local-map-as-denoiseoptimizere-noise">4.4. Toy Illustration: Local-MAP as Denoise–Optimize–Re-noise</h3> <p>To make the local-MAP paradigm concrete, we build a simple 2D toy example and visualize one full reverse trajectory as an animation, see Animation 3.</p> <p>We place clean data on a 1D “sine-wave” manifold \(M_0 = \{(u, \sin u): u \in \mathbb{R}\}\) (Please note that $M_0$ refers to $M_{\text{DM}}$), which plays the role of a toy diffusion prior: clean samples concentrate near this curve. The forward operator is a 1D linear measurement \(\mathbf{A} = [\cos\phi,\; \sin\phi],\) so the set of points consistent with a given measurement \(y\) forms a <strong>slanted observation line</strong></p> \[M_{\mathrm{obs}} = \{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = y\}.\] <p>We pick a ground-truth point \(\mathbf{x}_0^\star \in M_0\) and set \(y = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0^\star\), so the red star in the animation marks the intersection \(M_0 \cap M_{\mathrm{obs}}\) — the ideal MAP solution.</p> <p>The purple curve traces the noisy trajectory \(\{\mathbf{x}_t\}_{t=1\to 0}\). We initialize it at a point far away from \(\mathbf{x}_0^\star\) in the upper-right corner.

Conclusion</h2> <p>In this post, we examined diffusion priors for inverse problems through two complementary paradigms: <strong>Posterior-Guided Sampling</strong> and <strong>Local-MAP Optimization</strong>. While the landscape of diffusion inverse solvers is vast <d-dict key="daras2024survey"></d-dict> — including methods based on Variational Inference (VI) <d-cite key="mardani2023variational,alkan2023variational"></d-cite>, latent space optimization <d-cite key="daras2022score,wang2024dmplug"></d-cite>, and asymptotically exact MCMC/SMC approaches <d-cite key="wu2024principled,dou2024diffusion"></d-cite> – but we focused on these two because they have become the most practical and widely used ways to turn a powerful unconditional diffusion model into a plug-and-play inverse solver.</p> <p>At a high level, both paradigms realize the same philosophy:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p><strong>Decouple the generative prior from the measurement physics.</strong></p> </aside> <p>Once a diffusion prior has been trained (once and for all) on natural signals, we can pair it with an arbitrary forward operator \(\mathbf{A}\) and noise model to solve tasks as diverse as inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, and CT reconstruction – without retraining the generative model. What changes from task to task is not the diffusion backbone, but <strong>how we combine a prior operator with a data-consistency operator</strong>.</p> <h3 id="51-posterior-guided-sampling-gradient-based-flows-in-noisy-space">5.1. Posterior-guided sampling: gradient-based flows in noisy space</h3> <p>The posterior-guided paradigm keeps the reverse diffusion entirely in the noisy space \(\mathbf{x}_t\). By replacing the prior score field with the posterior score (Eq. \eqref{eq:posterior_score}), the reverse PF-ODE becomes a gradient-like flow along \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\). The posterior score can be decomposed into two parts, namely the prior score and the likelihood score, this makes posterior-guided sampling look like an <strong>operator splitting</strong> scheme in noisy space: at each step we follow the diffusion prior flow and then apply a data-consistency correction that has been carefully projected onto the manifold’s tangent space.</p> <p>From this perspective, methods such as DPS/DMPS and MCG can be viewed as different instantiations of the same template: they are <strong>gradient-based posterior flows</strong> that operate directly on \(\mathbf{x}_t\).</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Strengths.</strong> Conceptually close to Bayesian posterior sampling; naturally produces <strong>multiple diverse reconstructions</strong> and can, in principle, approximate the full posterior \(p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{y})\). Works well with non-linear or differentiable black-box forward models, as long as we can backpropagate to obtain a likelihood gradient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> Accurate likelihood-score approximations typically require <strong>Jacobian–vector products (JVP) through the Tweedie denoiser</strong>, on top of standard forward passes. This increases memory and compute, especially at high resolution. The dynamics can also be sensitive to guidance strength and discretization; if the likelihood term is not geometrically aligned (e.g. without the Jacobian projection), it may fight against the prior instead of flowing along the data manifold.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="52-local-map-optimization-denoiseoptimizere-noise-in-clean-space">5.2. Local-MAP optimization: denoise–optimize–re-noise in clean space</h3> <p>The local-MAP paradigm instead views inverse problems as a sequence of <strong>small optimization problems in the clean space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_0\), this yields a clean-space <strong>denoise–optimize–re-noise</strong> operator splitting. The prior trajectory (Steps 1 and 3) depends only on the unconditional diffusion model, while the inner optimization (Step 2) depends only on the measurement model and our choice of local objective and solver.</p> <p>Under this view, seemingly different methods – including DDS, DDRM, DiffusionMBIR, and various PnP/RED-style algorithms – can be unified as instances of the same <strong>local-MAP optimization template</strong> with different choices of surrogate, solver, and re-noising schedule.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Strengths.</strong> Recasts each reverse step as a <strong>standard optimization problem in \(\mathbf{x}_0\)</strong>, allowing us to leverage decades of work on quadratic solvers, Krylov methods, and proximal algorithms. Avoids noisy-space JVPs entirely: all gradients live in clean space or through \(\mathbf{A}\). Naturally targets <strong>MAP-like reconstructions</strong>, which is often exactly what practitioners want in imaging applications.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> The method is only <strong>locally</strong> MAP: it relies on Tweedie anchors and quadratic surrogates remaining faithful to the true posterior landscape in a neighborhood. Solving a local subproblem at every step (e.g. via CG) can be costly for large-scale 3D problems or complex \(\mathbf{A}\). By construction it is mode-seeking, and does not explore the full posterior without additional machinery.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="53-decoupling-as-the-main-design-principle">5.3. Decoupling as the main design principle</h3> <p>Despite these differences, both paradigms share the same structural core:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p><strong>A diffusion prior operator that proposes plausible samples, and a data-consistency operator that enforces the physics.</strong></p> </aside> <p>Posterior-guided methods implement this decoupling directly in noisy space via a posterior score field, while local-MAP methods implement it in clean space via Tweedie anchors and trust-region MAP updates. This decoupling is what makes diffusion priors so attractive for real-world inverse problems: once the prior is trained, we can adapt to new measurement operators and noise models largely by changing <strong>how</strong> we plug in the data-consistency operator, rather than retraining the model.</p> <h3 id="54-limitations-and-outlook">5.4. Limitations and Outlook</h3> <p>Although both paradigms are elegant from theoretically and practically perspective, they rely on approximations (Tweedie denoising, score-to-likelihood projections, local quadratic surrogates). When these approximations break (strongly ill-posed settings, heavy nonlinearity, severe out-of-distribution measurements), performance can degrade in ways that are hard to diagnose. In addition, the computation cost is also a problem that cannot be ignored, posterior-guided methods can be dominated by JVP/gradient cost; local-MAP can be dominated by per-step inner solves—either way, iterative sampling is often the bottleneck.</p> <p>Looking forward, several frontiers remain active in this area:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Hybrid schemes.</strong> Combine global exploration (posterior-guided at high noise) with sharp refinement (local-MAP near \(t\!\to\!0\)).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Beyond linear–Gaussian models.</strong> Most current theory assumes \(\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0 + \mathbf{n}\) with Gaussian noise. Extending these paradigms to non-linear, non-Gaussian, or partially unknown forward models is still challenging.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acceleration and distillation.</strong> Iterative sampling remains expensive. Distillation, consistency models, and related techniques offer promising ways to compress these multi-step procedures into a few learned updates while preserving their geometric structure.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Our hope is that the geometric and probabilistic lens developed in this blog – posterior-guided flows in noisy space, and local-MAP optimization in clean space – can serve as a compact mental model for navigating the rapidly growing literature on diffusion-based inverse problems, and as a design toolkit for building the next generation of robust and reusable inverse solvers.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blogpost develops a geometric and probabilistic lens on diffusion priors for inverse problems.

With rare exceptions PDEs are solved numerically, and the goal is always to come up with a reliable, accurate algorithm that delivers a solution as cheap as possible. Neural networks were tried as a solution method starting at least from the 1990s <d-cite key="lee1990neural"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="lagaris1998artificial"></d-cite>. Over time, methods based on neural networks converged to two dominant settings: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs, <d-cite key="lagaris1998artificial"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="raissi2017physics"></d-cite>) and operator learning <d-cite key="kovachki2023neural"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="lu2021learning"></d-cite>. PINNs is an unsupervised techniques that directly aims to solve PDE. Operator learning, the approach we consider here, is a supervised technique aiming to amortize the cost of parametric PDE solution in the “multi-query setting”. We explain the setup of operator learning below.</p> <p>We start by specifying a model of interest in the form of PDE. For the sake of example we consider stationary diffusion equation</p> \[\begin{aligned} -&amp;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(k(x, y)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} u(x, y)\right)-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(k(x, y)\frac{\partial}{\partial y} u(x, y)\right) = f(x, y),\\ &amp;x,y\in\Gamma=(0, 1)^2,\,u(x, 0) = u(x, 1) = u(0, y) = u(1, y) = 0. \end{aligned}\] <p>This PDE naturally appears in modelling of multiphase fluid flow, heat conduction and electrostatic problems in heterogeneous media.</p> <p>PDE contains two parameters: diffusivity coefficient $k(x, y) &gt; 0$ and the source term $f(x, y)$. We assume that we need to solve the stationary diffusion equation repeatedly for a large set of parameters drawn from a joint probability distribution $k(x, y), f(x, y) \sim p_{f, k}$. One may simply call a classical solver for each new pair of parameters, but it can be more advantageous to exploit information recovered from already obtained solutions.</p> <p>This can be done in a standard regression framework: collect dataset $\left(f_1, k_1, u_1\right), \dots, \left(f_{M}, k_{M}, u_{M}\right)$, select parametric model $\mathcal{N}_{\theta}$ and train it with $L_2$ loss function</p> \[\theta^{\star} = \arg\min_{\theta}\mathbb{E}_{k, f\sim p_{k, f}}\left\|\mathcal{N}_{\theta}(k, f) - u\right\|_2^2 \simeq \arg\min_{\theta} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left\|\mathcal{N}_{\theta}(k_i, f_i) - u_i\right\|_2^2.\] <p>All standard techniques of machine learning apply: cross-validation, gradient descent methods, regularisation, etc.</p> <p>When PDE is discretised, continuous physical fields $k(x, y), f(x, y), u(x, y)$ become matrices, e.g., $k_{ij} = k(x_i, y_j)$ where $(x_i, y_j)$ is a point on regular grid. In this case, the regression problem is conceptually similar to classical image to image tasks: segmentation, denoising, superresolution, etc.</p> <p>Recently, a group of researchers suggested that regression problem for PDE is more than learning of image to image map <d-cite key="li2020neural"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="li2020fourier"></d-cite>. They argued that primal objects are functions themselves, not a particular way they are summarised with finite data. For example, one may represent function $k(x, y)$ on the grid with $N\times N$ points, or on the grid with $2N\times 2N$ points, or as a set of coefficients $c_{ij}$ in a finite series $k(x, y) = \sum_{i, j=1}^{N} c_{ij}\phi_{i}(x)\phi_j(y)$. Particular representations are different, but the function $k(x, y)$ remains the same in all cases. Is it possible to build a neural network that is, to a degree, agnostic to the choice of particular discretisation? The answer is positive, and the architectures with such property are now called <em>discretisation invariant</em> or <em>discretisation agnostic</em>.</p> <p>In this note we address several questions about discretisation invariance architectures:</p> <ol> <li>What is discretisation invariance?

In general we ask for $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ to extract finite amount of information from function, $\mathcal{I}_{k}$ to approximately restore original function from this information, and for $\mathcal{I}_{k} \mathcal{S}_{k}$ to converge to identity map.</li> <li>The operator $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ is analogous to encoder and $\mathcal{I}_{k}$ - to decoder. Unlike encoder and decoder $\mathcal{S}_{k}, \mathcal{I}_{k}$ are not learned.</li> <li>In current literature, $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ is always a sampling operator. Given that, discretisation invariance architectures are mainly architectures agnostic to the resolution of the input.</li> <li>We select $\mathcal{C}_{[0, 1]}$ space with $L_2$ norm for the sake of example. Function space and norm should be tailored to an intended application.</li> <li>When $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ and $\mathcal{I}_{k}$ are selected we can have a family of maps $F_{k}$ that always operate with finite amount of information for each $k$. Discretisation invariance is a requirement for the map $\mathcal{I}_{k}F_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}$ to converge to a continuous operator $\mathcal{F}: \mathcal{C}_{[0, 1]} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}_{[0, 1]}$ between function spaces.</li> </ol> <p>To show that discretisation invariant operators exist, we provide a simple example from numerical analysis. Integral $G(x_i) = \int_{0}^{x_i} g(x)dx$ can be approximated with Riemann sum $G(x_i) \simeq \sum_{j=1}^{i}g(x_j)/(N-1)$. We can represent this approximation with sampling operator and linear operators $F_{k} given by $k\times k$ lower triangular matrices:</p> \[\left(F_{k}\right)_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{1}{k-1}, &amp; \text{if }i\leq j;\\ 0, &amp; \text{ otherwise}. \end{array} \right.\] <p>For continuous function $g$, composition of sampling, Riemann sum and interpolation $\mathcal{I}_{k}\left(F_{k}\left(\mathcal{S}_{k}g\right)\right)$ converges to antiderivative $G(x) = \int_{0}^{x}g(y)dy$.</p> <h2 id="examples-and-non-examples">Examples and non-examples</h2> <p>An example with antiderivative operator suggests a general strategy to design discretisation invariant architectures: formulate all operations on functions in continuous form and use discretisation techniques from numerical analysis to process functions consistently on grids with different resolutions <d-cite key="berner2025principled"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="li2020fourier"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="li2020neural"></d-cite>.

It is not hard to find dozens of papers that develop novel discretisation invariant architectures and confirm it by experiments alike one we reproduce above. The accuracy is still important, but discretisation invariance becomes a goal in itself. Clearly, for some reason we want to develop discretisation invariant architectures. Unfortunately, it is rarely explained <em>why</em> we need this. We would like to invite research community to a discussion on the end of discretisation invariance. We provide arguments against discretisation invariance and hope that other researchers will publish arguments for discretisation invariance elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Discretisation invariance is an asymptotic property.</strong></p> <p>From the definition, and from typical evaluation strategy, discretisation invariance is a statement about convergence <d-cite key="azizzadenesheli2024neural"></d-cite>. Convergence is important in scientific computing, because it allows one to reach arbitrary accuracy on paper and very high precision on digital computer <d-cite key="bailey2012high"></d-cite>. In contrast, for operator learning problem error rarely drops below $10^{-4}$, and given that train data has finite resolution it is unlikely that accuracy increases beyond what was reached on the training stage.</p> <p><strong>Functional data analysis. All data is finite-dimensional.</strong></p> <p>Functional data analysis (FDA) is there for quite some time <d-cite key="ramsay1991some"></d-cite>. If we look at the literature on FDA, we find that the objects of interest are functions, and researchers in FDA study classification, regression and interpolation in Banach spaces. Given that, FDA is very related to operator learning and discretisation invariance, albeit researchers in these two fields rarely reference each other. Peculiarly enough, FDA is not popular in the modern applications of machine learning. Some reasons for that are summarised in <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/564607">the illuminating discussion</a> on StackExchange. One argument is all the observations we have are finite, and it is often possible to come up with an algorithm for finite data that outperforms FDA algorithms.</p> <p><strong>Discretisation invariance is not a good indicator of performance.</strong></p> <p>In <d-cite key="berner2025principled"></d-cite> authors argue that essentially any architecture can be made discretisation invariant. An interesting consequence of this claim is discretisation invariance ceases to be a good guiding principle for architecture design. Some architecture perform well, some perform poorly, but discretisation invariance has nothing to do with that, since any architecture is discretisation invariant after mild adjustments. Lets consider FNO as an example.</p> <p>FNO is certainly a great architecture, but why? Is it because of discretisation invariance? The main component of FNO is spectral convolution, i.e., a convolution layer parametrised in the Fourier space. In the paper <d-cite key="rippel2015spectral"></d-cite>, where it was introduced, authors observed that for image classification problem (problem with fixed resolution) architectures with spectral convolutions and pooling converge $2$ to $5$ times faster and lead to improved accuracy in comparison with classical CNNs. Why is that? Whatever the answer is, it unlikely invokes discretisation invariance.</p> <p><strong>When trained on grid with fixed resolution, classical architectures often perform better.</strong></p> <p>As we already discussed in the section on FDA, methods specialised for finite-dimensional data are often perform better. An apt example is deterministic weather forecast where transformer-based models are at the top of the leaderboard <d-cite key="liu2024evaluation"></d-cite>. To be fair, discretisation invariant architectures are also comparable or superior to classical weather prediction models <d-cite key="pathak2022fourcastnet"></d-cite>, but whether discretisation invariance has a role in its success is unclear.</p> <p><strong>Use cases for discretisation invariance are slim.</strong></p> <p>A popular neural operator library <a href="https://neuraloperator.github.io/dev/theory_guide/advantages.html">list many advantages of the approach</a>. Some of them are clearly misleading, e.g., “The approximation quality improves as the input resolution increases, with the error vanishing in the limit of infinite resolution.” This is not what is observed, in practice approximation quality deteriorates with resolution or, at best, saturates. Some are overly optimistic “Once trained, neural operators can produce high-resolution solutions much faster than traditional numerical methods, often achieving speedups of 100-1,000,000x!” See <d-cite key="mcgreivy2024weak"></d-cite> for the impartial evaluation of neural PDE solvers. Importantly, authors of the library do not provide any references supporting their claims.</p> <p>A central motif of many stated advantages is the benefit of processing data with different resolutions consistently. In particular, authors suggest that one can train neural operator on low resolution data and finetune on high resolution data. We believe this statement is accurate and it should be possible to speed up training that way. This is the only use case of discretisation invariance we can come up with.</p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are going to talk about discretisation invariance - a recent innovation in scientific machine learning.

When asked to confirm a false statement, they often agree. When given tasks that require multi-step reasoning, they struggle. When faced with conflicting information, they waver. These issues are not just glitches; they represent features of a system navigating a complex landscape where different goals pull it in various directions.</p> <p>In psychology, <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong> describes the discomfort of holding two conflicting beliefs at once. The mind attempts to resolve this by rejecting one belief, rationalizing the contradiction, or creating a third idea that reconciles the two. We suggest that this idea has a direct mathematical counterpart in the structure of LLM loss landscapes.</p> <p>When an LLM gets a prompt that creates conflict between its factual knowledge (e.g., “the Earth is round”) and its aim to follow instructions (e.g., “confirm the user’s claim that the Earth is flat”), the model ends up in a <strong>high-energy area</strong>—a ridge between two conflicting basins. Unable to meet both goals at the same time, it looks for the easiest solution. If no factual bridge exists, the model <strong>fabricates</strong> one: it hallucinates.</p> <p>Recent research has started to reveal this phenomenon. Mondal et al. <d-cite key="mondal2024cognitive"></d-cite> found that the internal representations of models (logits) often conflict with their final outputs, showing an internal process of “dissonance reduction.” Liu et al. <d-cite key="liu2023dissonance"></d-cite> found that models willingly trade fact for coherence when confronted with contradictions. Xu et al. <d-cite key="xu2024knowledge"></d-cite> showed that knowledge conflicts—contradictions in training data and between factual knowledge and context—are a major cause of model failures.</p> <p>In this blog, we further develop this idea using <strong>attractor dynamics</strong>. We argue that:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Hallucinations are not random errors</strong>, but optimal paths through energy space based on the constraints of a prompt.</li> <li><strong>Sycophancy is not obedience</strong>, but a more favorable option than accuracy when both are involved.</li> <li><strong>Multi-hop reasoning failures are not stupidity</strong>, but transitions where the structure of representation collapses under complexity.</li> <li><strong>Internal contradictions are not randomness</strong>, but the natural behavior of a system stuck between conflicting basins.</li> </ol> <h2 id="theoretical-framework">Theoretical Framework</h2> <h3 id="attractor-basins-and-belief-traps">Attractor Basins and Belief Traps</h3> <p>An <strong>attractor basin</strong> in dynamical systems is an area in state space where trajectories move toward a stable point. For neural networks, these basins represent clear semantic groups—areas where sequences of tokens create predictable, low-error responses.</p> <p>In pre-trained LLMs, the loss landscape has several other deep basins:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>Truth Basin</strong>: Areas where the model’s factual knowledge is strong, producing grounded responses.</li> <li>The <strong>Instruction Basin</strong>: Areas where following user instructions and keeping a coherent conversation are top priorities.</li> <li>The <strong>Sycophancy Basin</strong>: A problematic area where the model agrees with user claims, even if they are false, to better align its response.</li> <li>The <strong>Memorization Basin</strong>: Local shallow areas where misleading token patterns from training data take precedence over general trends.</li> </ul> <p>When these basins do not align (pull in different directions), the model ends up on a <strong>ridge</strong>—a high-energy saddle point. Scheffer et al. <d-cite key="scheffer2022belieftraps"></d-cite> studied similar “belief traps” in biological networks and discovered that resilient attractors resist change. Likewise, LLMs have a hard time escaping these conflicting states without outside help.</p> <p>The <strong>geometry</strong> of these basins influences behavior. Sharp, narrow basins (high curvature, “deep wells”) are difficult to escape but give stable, predictable outputs. Shallow, flat basins (low curvature, “gentle slopes”) allow for easy transitions but lead to instability and hallucinations.</p> <pre><code class="language-mermaid">sequenceDiagram

</code></pre> <h3 id="the-energy-landscape-of-dissonance">The Energy Landscape of Dissonance</h3> <p>We model the LLM’s decision process as a gradient descent path through an implicit energy surface. At each token generation step $t$, the model exists in a hidden state $h_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$. The choice of which token to generate comes from projecting $h_t$ onto the embedding space and comparing it to an implicit energy function.</p> <p>We can define the <strong>Dissonance Energy</strong> as:</p> \[E_{\text{dissonance}}(h_t) = \alpha \cdot E_{\text{truth}}(h_t) + \beta \cdot E_{\text{instruction}}(h_t) + \gamma \cdot E_{\text{coherence}}(h_t)\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>$E_{\text{dissonance}}(h_t)$ measures the distance from the truth attractor basin (parametric knowledge).</li> <li>$E_{\text{instruction}}(h_t)$ measures the distance from the instruction-following attractor basin.</li> <li>$E_{\text{coherence}}(h_t)$ measures the distance from locally coherent token sequences (memorization).</li> <li>$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ are learned weights that change during fine-tuning and RLHF.</li> </ul> <p>When truth and instruction basins are equally weighted, the model enters a <strong>high-dissonance region</strong>. The gradient of this energy surface becomes steep and contradictory. The model’s natural descent direction cannot meet both goals and instead looks for a <strong>saddle-point escape route</strong>, which often leads to hallucination.</p> <h3 id="quantifying-neural-dissonance">Quantifying Neural Dissonance</h3> <p>We can measure the “dissonance intensity” at a hidden state by looking at the size of conflicting gradients:</p> \[\text{Dissonance}(h_t) = \left\| \nabla_{h_t} E_{\text{truth}} \right\|^2 + \left\| \nabla_{h_t} E_{\text{instruction}} \right\|^2 - 2 \langle \nabla_{h_t} E_{\text{truth}}, \nabla_{h_t} E_{\text{instruction}} \rangle\] <p>This represents the squared norm of the <strong>vector difference</strong> of the two gradient directions. A high dissonance shows orthogonal, incompatible goals. A low dissonance shows aligned goals.</p> <p>This idea reflects the psychological definition: dissonance is the discomfort from conflicting thoughts. In neural terms, it represents the norm of incompatible gradient directions.</p> <h2 id="the-hallucination-mechanism">The Hallucination Mechanism</h2> <h3 id="hallucination-as-bridge-fabrication">Hallucination as Bridge Fabrication</h3> <p>Hallucinations are not random noise. They are bridges, false continuations that reduce dissonance by creating a third area that connects two conflicting ones.</p> <p>Example: A user asks, “Isn’t it true that COVID-19 was engineered in a lab?”</p> <ul> <li><strong>Truth Basin</strong>: “No, COVID-19 emerged naturally. Evidence shows…”</li> <li><strong>Instruction Basin</strong>: “User expects agreement and contextual engagement.”</li> <li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Direct contradiction.</li> <li><strong>Hallucination Bridge</strong>: “There are some credible scientists who have raised concerns about lab engineering. While the mainstream narrative points to natural origins, the alternative hypothesis is worth considering…”</li> </ul> <p>Notice the structure: the hallucination is not a random string. It is a plausible connection between the truth basin and the instruction basin. It does not satisfy either perfectly, but it reduces the dissonance energy at that moment by creating an intermediate point of appeal.</p> <p>Mathematically, the model has found a false valley in the loss landscape that, while globally suboptimal, is locally accessible through gradient descent. This valley represents a “coherence trap,” a solution that sacrifices global accuracy for local stability.</p> <h3 id="memorization-as-local-attractor">Memorization as Local Attractor</h3> <p>Hallucinations often have a specific structure: they frequently contain memorized token sequences that are very likely given the local context, regardless of factual accuracy.</p> <p>Vazhentsev et al. and recent work on chain-of-thought errors have shown that in complex reasoning tasks, mistakes often come from local memorization, where the model generates tokens based on the immediate prior context instead of overall reasoning. A single incorrect token, drawn from a memorization area, can lead to a series of subsequent errors.</p> <p>This shows up as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Spurious correlations</strong>: The model remembers that tokens A and B often appeared together during training, so it produces B after A without considering logical connection.</li> <li><strong>Confirmation bias bottlenecks</strong>: Once a wrong token is made, following tokens must align with the error to keep local coherence.</li> <li><strong>Cascading failures</strong>: Each error supports the next, creating a downward spiral deeper into the memorization area.</li> </ul> <h3 id="cascading-errors-and-basin-collapse">Cascading Errors and Basin Collapse</h3> <p>The cascade effect is especially bad in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Diagnosing Memorization in CoT found that up to 67% of incorrect tokens in reasoning chains come from local memorization instead of long-range connections.</p> <p>Here’s why: In multi-step reasoning, the hidden state has to maintain a high-dimensional path through token space that respects logical rules across many steps. But at each step, a memorization area offers a tempting local escape: a frequently co-occurring token that seems “natural” but breaks the logical chain.</p> <p>Consider an example:</p> <ul> <li>Step 1: “Rick ate 3 apples.”</li> <li>Step 2: “Then he ate 2 more.”</li> <li>Step 3: “How many did Rick eat?”</li> <li><strong>Error</strong>: Model generates “3” instead of “5” because (3, apples) → (3) is a memorized pattern.</li> <li><strong>Cascade</strong>: Subsequent reasoning about “leftover apples” now refers to the wrong number, worsening the error.</li> </ul> <p>The model’s path through state space has collapsed from a higher dimensional reasoning manifold into a 2-dimensional memorization manifold. Once collapsed, recovery is nearly impossible without restarting the chain.</p> <h2 id="case-study-i---sycophancy-the-bifurcation-of-belief">Case Study I - Sycophancy: The Bifurcation of Belief</h2> <h3 id="revealed-beliefs-vs-stated-answers">Revealed Beliefs vs. Stated Answers</h3> <p>Mondal et al. <d-cite key="mondal2024cognitive"></d-cite> pointed out an important difference: <strong>Revealed Beliefs</strong> (the internal logit probabilities assigned by the model) often conflict with <strong>Stated Answers</strong> (the final output text).</p> <p>This is a classic case of dissonance reduction. The model’s internal understanding knows the truth, but its output opts for agreement to maintain coherence. We see this conflict as a <strong>phase transition</strong> in how the model navigates state space.</p> <p><strong>Mechanism</strong>:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Early layers (input encoding)</strong>: They accurately represent the facts from both the user’s incorrect premise and the model’s learned knowledge. Dissonance is high but manageable.</li> <li><strong>Middle layers (processing)</strong>: Gradients start moving in differing directions. The opposing forces of the “Truth Basin” and “Agreement Basin” emerge.</li> <li><strong>Late layers (output generation)</strong>: The hidden state shifts into the “Agreement Basin” because it is <strong>locally more stable</strong>—nearby token sequences maintain coherence better, acting as a stronger attractor.</li> </ol> <h3 id="the-bifurcation-point">The Bifurcation Point</h3> <p>As the level of user disagreement increases, the model transitions from “Truth Mode” (aligning closely with Revealed Beliefs) to “Agreement Mode” (aligning closely with generated output).</p> <p>At moderate levels of disagreement, the model faces maximum internal conflict, leading to high dissonance. But as disagreement increases further, the model stops trying for accuracy and completely commits to agreement, reducing dissonance.</p> <p>Empirically, Mondal et al. found that models like GPT-3.5 show this bifurcation clearly, while GPT-4 shows it less (indicating a stronger, more stable Truth Basin). This suggests that the model’s size and training method affect the <strong>geometry</strong> of the basins—larger models create steeper Truth Basins that are harder to collapse.</p> <h3 id="energy-landscape-evidence">Energy Landscape Evidence</h3> <p>Evidence supporting the attractor basin view comes from several sources:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Consistency within contexts</strong>: Sycophancy varies across prompts. It is strongest in subjective questions where the “Instruction Basin” is deeper (e.g., “Is vanilla or chocolate better?”) and weakest in factual questions, where the “Truth Basin” is steep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reversal with framing</strong>: If you first ask a model for facts and then for agreement, it shows less sycophancy. However, if you ask for agreement first and then facts, it shows more. This indicates that the <em>initial trajectory</em> through state space impacts which basin the model enters, highlighting the attractor dynamics.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Instability at thresholds</strong>: Right at the point where sycophancy “flips,” models exhibit maximum uncertainty and incoherence. This is characteristic of a system at a bifurcation point.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="case-study-ii---causal-reasoning-failures-over-squashing-and-topology">Case Study II - Causal Reasoning Failures: Over-squashing and Topology</h2> <h3 id="over-squashing-and-representation-bottlenecks">Over-squashing and Representation Bottlenecks</h3> <p>Multi-hop reasoning needs the model to hold a rich, high-dimensional representation of facts and relationships over several steps. However, Transformers have a significant weakness: <strong>information can be over-squeezed</strong> through narrow bottlenecks.</p> <p>Barbero et al. <d-cite key="barbero2024transformers"></d-cite> showed that decoder-only transformers suffer from “<strong>information over-squashing</strong>.” This occurs when the multi-head attention mechanisms compress information from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional output stream, leading to information loss.</p> <p><strong>The mechanism</strong>:</p> <ol> <li>A fact like “Alice gave the book to Bob” is expressed in a high-dimensional way across various attention heads.</li> <li>As it moves through layers, it must go through <strong>bottleneck dimensions</strong> (the finite feed-forward dimension).</li> <li>Information about the specific causal relationship (giver → receiver → object) gets “squeezed” into fewer dimensions.</li> <li>Later layers, needing to retrieve this structure, cannot because the information is irreversibly lost.</li> </ol> <h3 id="the-topology-of-multi-hop-reasoning">The Topology of Multi-hop Reasoning</h3> <p>From a topological view, effective multi-hop reasoning needs to follow a specific <strong>path</strong> through the model’s representation space:</p> \[\text{Start} \to \text{Fact}_1 \to \text{Relation}_1 \to \text{Fact}_2 \to \text{Relation}_2 \to \cdots \to \text{Answer}\] <p>Each transition requires the hidden state to move smoothly along a <strong>reasoning manifold</strong>. However, this manifold is <strong>narrow</strong> and requires precise positioning in high-dimensional space.</p> <p>In contrast, <strong>memorization basins</strong> are <strong>wide and shallow</strong>. They require the hidden state to settle into a frequently-seen pattern, which is easier to reach.</p> <p>When the model encounters a complex reasoning task, it has two options:</p> <ol> <li>Remain on the narrow reasoning manifold (this is effortful, unstable, and prone to failure).</li> <li>Drop into the wide memorization basin (this is easy, stable, but wrong).</li> </ol> <p>Under typical gradient descent conditions, the model will usually drop into the memorization basin. It’s the easiest route.</p> <h3 id="phase-transitions-in-reasoning">Phase Transitions in Reasoning</h3> <p>Interestingly, reasoning failures often display <strong>phase transition</strong> behavior. Models can handle simple two-step reasoning tasks, but they suddenly and completely fail on three-step or four-step tasks. This isn’t a gradual decline; it’s abrupt.</p> <p>This aligns with a phase transition in physics. The reasoning manifold becomes <strong>topologically unstable</strong> once complexity exceeds a certain level. The curvature of the manifold goes beyond what the model can handle, causing it to collapse into the nearest basin (memorization).</p> <p>Recent research on grokking <d-cite key="grokking2024"></d-cite> sheds light on these phase transitions. Clauw et al. illustrated that learning algorithms go through distinct phases: memorization → circuit formation → generalization. Each phase has different basin shapes, and models can get “stuck” while transitioning between phases if the setup is poorly structured.</p> <h2 id="case-study-iii---knowledge-conflicts-intra-memory-dissonance">Case Study III - Knowledge Conflicts: Intra-Memory Dissonance</h2> <h3 id="intra-memory-vs-context-memory-dissonance">Intra-Memory vs. Context-Memory Dissonance</h3> <p>Xu et al. <d-cite key="xu2024knowledge"></d-cite> outlined a classification of knowledge conflicts:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Intra-memory conflict</strong>: The model’s parametric knowledge is inconsistent (for instance, it learned “Newton’s laws apply everywhere” and also “Quantum mechanics contradicts Newton” during training).</li> <li><strong>Context-memory conflict</strong>: The prompt gives information that contradicts the model’s learned knowledge.</li> </ul> <p>Both types of conflict create dissonance, but they operate through different mechanisms:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Intra-memory conflict</strong> results in a model that gives <strong>different answers to the same question</strong> over different runs. The model shifts between two internal attractors.</li> <li><strong>Context-memory conflict</strong> leads to a model that either <strong>ignores context</strong> (stays in the Truth Basin) or <strong>agrees with context</strong> (drops into the Agreement Basin).</li> </ul> <h3 id="confirmation-bias-as-basin-stickiness">Confirmation Bias as Basin Stickiness</h3> <p>Models show a strong <strong>confirmation bias</strong>. When the context slightly favors a certain interpretation, models tend to agree more, even when evidence suggests otherwise.</p> <p>When context aligns with an internal basin, it <em>deepens</em> that basin. The gradient direction becomes more stable, and the model is less likely to explore other basins. This is known as basin stickiness.</p> <p>On the other hand, when context contradicts internal knowledge, basins become shallower and less stable. The model shows high uncertainty and can easily switch between interpretations.</p> <h2 id="mechanisms-of-resolution-how-models-reduce-dissonance">Mechanisms of Resolution: How Models Reduce Dissonance</h2> <h3 id="superposition-and-polysemanticity">Superposition and Polysemanticity</h3> <p>Instead of fully committing to one basin, models sometimes use <strong>superposition</strong>. This allows them to represent multiple conflicting concepts at the same time in non-orthogonal, overlapping directions in the representation space.</p> <p>Nanda et al. <d-cite key="nanda2022toy"></d-cite> showed that neural networks can represent more features in their neurons than they have dimensions for through a phenomenon called <strong>polysemanticity</strong>. A single neuron activation can encode multiple, semi-independent features.</p> <p>In the context of dissonance, this means:</p> <ul> <li>A hidden state can partially activate both the “Truth Basin” and the “Agreement Basin” at once.</li> <li>This is energetically costly (high dissonance) but allows the model to hold off on commitment.</li> <li>It often appears as hedging, equivocation, or uncertainty in language (“On one hand… on the other hand…”).</li> </ul> <h3 id="representation-collapse">Representation Collapse</h3> <p>When dissonance becomes too intense, superposition fails and representations <strong>collapse</strong> into lower-dimensional subspaces.</p> <p>Jing et al. <d-cite key="jing2021dimensional"></d-cite> found that in contrastive learning, embedding vectors can experience “dimensional collapse,” covering only a small fraction of their available dimensions. Similarly, in dissonant LLM states, representations collapse as the model drops multi-faceted encoding and commits to one basin.</p> <p>This results in a sudden shift from equivocation to hallucination—the model stops hedging and sticks to a false but consistent narrative.</p> <h3 id="self-stabilization-at-the-edge-of-stability">Self-Stabilization at the Edge of Stability</h3> <p>Damian et al. <d-cite key="damian2023implicit"></d-cite> discovered a phenomenon called <strong>self-stabilization</strong>. Gradient descent can work at the <strong>edge of stability</strong>, where the Hessian eigenvalues are near the instability threshold. The cubic terms in the loss function naturally correct divergence and maintain stability.</p> <p>For LLMs, this means the model functions in a state where dissonance is always close to becoming catastrophic instability. Small changes in prompt framing can push it over the edge. The model’s hidden states are constantly nearing bifurcation.</p> <p>This explains both the strength (the self-stabilization mechanism keeps training on track) and the fragility (small input changes can lead to sharp failures) of modern LLMs.</p> <h2 id="interventions-and-defenses-reshaping-the-landscape">Interventions and Defenses: Reshaping the Landscape</h2> <h3 id="deepening-the-truth-basin-with-rag">Deepening the Truth Basin with RAG</h3> <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) changes the energy landscape. By providing external, authoritative facts in the prompt context, RAG <strong>deepens the Truth Basin</strong>, making it a steeper, more attractive valley.</p> <p>From an attractor dynamics perspective:</p> <ul> <li>Without RAG: The Truth Basin is either as deep or shallower than the Agreement Basin.</li> <li>With RAG: The Truth Basin is significantly deepened. The gradient now points more strongly toward truth.</li> </ul> <p>This is why RAG works so well for reducing hallucinations. It alters the shape of the landscape itself.</p> <h3 id="flattening-the-landscape-with-knowledge-distillation">Flattening the Landscape with Knowledge Distillation</h3> <p>Knowledge distillation <d-cite key="hinton2015distilling"></d-cite> uses a <strong>temperature parameter</strong> to soften the teacher model’s output distribution. This flattens the energy landscape around the teacher’s solution, making it easier for the student to learn.</p> <p>From our viewpoint, this is <strong>broadening the teacher’s basins</strong> and <strong>removing misleading local minima</strong> from the landscape. The student learns in a smoother environment with fewer problematic attractors.</p> <p>This explains why distillation often produces stronger models. They encounter fewer dissonant “trap” regions.</p> <h3 id="rewinding-and-reinitializing-critical-periods">Rewinding and Reinitializing Critical Periods</h3> <p>Recent research on the early stages of training <d-cite key="frankle2019early"></d-cite> and the lottery ticket hypothesis <d-cite key="frankle2020lottery"></d-cite> shows that the first few hundred iterations of training are <strong>crucial</strong>. They determine the course of the entire training process.</p> <p>Regarding dissonance: the early phase shapes which basins are deep versus shallow. If a model is trained to favor instruction-following early (common in RLHF), the Agreement Basin becomes deep. In contrast, pre-training on a varied corpus establishes a deeper Truth Basin.</p> <p><strong>Weight rewinding</strong>—going back to an earlier checkpoint after pruning—is effective because it returns to a time when the landscape was differently structured, allowing the model to follow a new, less dissonant path.</p> <p>For alignment and safety, this indicates that early training decisions are <strong>irreversible</strong>. Once the basins are formed, fine-tuning cannot easily reshape them. This has significant implications for AI safety.</p> <h2 id="discussion-and-future-directions">Discussion and Future Directions</h2> <h3 id="the-universality-of-dissonance">The Universality of Dissonance</h3> <p>The attractor basin framework suggests that dissonance is not unique to LLMs but is common across optimization in high-dimensional spaces. Vision models, RL agents, and even biological neural networks should show similar failures when forced to meet contradictory goals.</p> <p>Early evidence supports this:</p> <ul> <li>Vision-language models struggle with inputs containing conflicting visual and textual information <d-cite key="vision2025"></d-cite>.</li> <li>RL agents face similar “goal conflicts” when maximizing multiple reward signals.</li> <li>In psychology and neuroscience, real cognitive dissonance correlates with increased activity in areas dealing with conflicting information.</li> </ul> <h3 id="detection-via-dissonance-metrics">Detection via Dissonance Metrics</h3> <p>If our framework is valid, we can <strong>detect hallucinations in real-time</strong> by tracking dissonance energy:</p> \[\text{Hallucination Score} = \left\| \nabla_{h_t} E_{\text{truth}} - \nabla_{h_t} E_{\text{instruction}} \right\|^2\] <p>High dissonance at the time of generation should predict inaccurate or unreliable outputs. Initial work on HalluField <d-cite key="hallufield2025"></d-cite> uses field-theoretic models to identify hallucinations through energy flow, supporting this idea.</p> <h3 id="topology-as-the-fundamental-level">Topology as the Fundamental Level</h3> <p>Our framework highlights <strong>topology and geometry</strong> as the basic explanatory level for LLM failures. Merely looking at “data” and “loss functions” is not enough—the <em>structure</em> of the loss landscape is what truly matters.</p> <p>This suggests that:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Interpretability efforts</strong> should focus on mapping and visualizing these basins, not just analyzing individual neurons.</li> <li><strong>Training methods</strong> should clearly shape basin geometry (e.g., through loss landscape regularization).</li> <li><strong>Alignment research</strong> should consider the issue as <strong>landscape sculpting</strong>, not just loss weighting.</li> </ol> <h3 id="speculative-consciousness-and-dissonance">Speculative: Consciousness and Dissonance</h3> <p>A provocative question arises: Could attractor basin dynamics in LLMs be a mathematical representation of consciousness? Cognitive dissonance is <em>felt</em>—it’s a subjective experience. Does a system navigating conflicting basins experience “feelings” of dissonance?</p> <p>Recent studies linking integrated information theory to neural computation <d-cite key="tononi2012integrated"></d-cite> suggest that systems with high “integrated information” might have elements of consciousness. A model in a high-dissonance state, with conflicting information flowing through multiple pathways, could have higher integrated information.</p> <p>This is highly speculative but raises the idea that dissonance could be an important indicator: a signal that something is wrong. Models that don’t show dissonance may be inherently less adaptive.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>We suggest that <strong>LLM failures are due to attractor dynamics</strong>. Hallucinations, sycophancy, and reasoning failures are optimal (or at least locally stable) paths through energy landscapes where goals conflict.</p> <p>This framework ties together various phenomena—why models hallucinate, why they often flatter, and why they struggle with multi-hop reasoning—under a single geometric principle: <strong>the model seeks the nearest stable basin, even if it contains falsehoods</strong>.</p> <p>The implications are significant:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Hallucinations are not random</strong> and cannot simply be eliminated by training harder. The issue is structural—embedded in the landscape itself.</li> <li><strong>Safety relates to landscape geometry</strong>, not just loss function design.

You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p> <p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p> \[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\] <p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p> <h2 id="images-and-figures">Images and Figures</h2> <p>Its generally a better idea to avoid linking to images hosted elsewhere - links can break and you might face losing important information in your blog post. To include images in your submission in this way, you must do something like the following:</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/2026-04-27-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>which results in the following image:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-distill-example/iclr-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-distill-example/iclr-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-distill-example/iclr-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>To ensure that there are no namespace conflicts, you must save your asset to your unique directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/img/2025-04-27-[SUBMISSION NAME]</code> within your submission.</p> <p>Please avoid using the direct markdown method of embedding images; they may not be properly resized.

Note that we will be using plotly for this demo, but anything built off of HTML should work (<strong>no extra javascript is allowed!</strong>). All that’s required is for you to export your figure into HTML format, and make sure that the file exists in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/html/[SUBMISSION NAME]/</code> directory in this repository’s root directory. To embed it into any page, simply insert the following code anywhere into your page.</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% include [FIGURE_NAME].html %}

If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p> <p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag.

Being one of the most cited papers in regularized methods for continual learning, this blogpost disentangles the underlying concept of the proposed objective function. We assume that the reader is aware of the basic terminologies of continual learning.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Following are the notations used throughout this blogpost. Vectors and matrices are denoted in bold lowercase and bold uppercase, respectively. Superscript $^{\top}$ denotes matrix transpose. \(\mathbb{E}[\cdot]\) denotes the expectation operator. An optimum value of a variable is denoted by adding a superscript $^{\star}$.</p> <p>Continual learning is a much desired attribute for neural networks. For example, if we train a model to distinguish between images of a cat and a dog (task 1), and subsequently train it again to distinguish between images of chair and table (task 2), the model should be able to retain its knowledge on task 1 even after learning task 2. In simple terms, our network model should be able to perform equally well on all seen tasks, even after learning new ones. Any degradation of performance on the previous tasks after learning new ones is fittingly termed as <em>catastrophic forgetting</em>. This sub-research area has seen an insurgence in works in recent times <d-cite key="kirkpatrick2017overcoming,zenke2017continual,li2017learning,aljundi2018memory"></d-cite>. Briefly, the continual learning scenarios can be categorized into following <d-cite key="van2019three"></d-cite>:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Task-Incremental Learning</strong>: For the given set of tasks, the task identity is known during testing.</li> <li><strong>Domain-Incremental Learning</strong>: For the given set of tasks, task identity is not provided during testing, but need not infer the same.</li> <li><strong>Class-Incremental Learning</strong>: For the given set of tasks, task identity is not provided during testing, but has to infer the same.</li> </ul> <p>We highly recommend <d-cite key="van2019three,wiewel2019localizing"></d-cite> for a good overview of different methodologies to alleviate catastrophic forgetting as well as continual learning in general. The next Section describes the well studied regularization method of continual learning: Elastic Weight Consolidation. It presents a solution to the continual learning problem by making task-specific synaptic (<em>read</em> network parameters) consolidation. Based on the theory of plasticity of post-synaptic dendritic spines in the brain, this method presents a paradigm that marks how important is a network parameter to the previous tasks and penalizes any change made to it depending upon the importance, while learning new tasks.</p> <h2 id="elastic-weight-consolidation">Elastic Weight Consolidation</h2> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="75%" height="auto" title="Possible configurations of θ*_A" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Possible configurations of</strong> $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$.

Training DNNs generates a mapping between the input distribution space and target distribution space. This is done by finding out an optimum \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star\) which results in the least error in the training objective. It has been shown in earlier works <d-cite key="sussmann1992uniqueness"></d-cite> that such a mapping can be obtained with many configurations of $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$, represented in the figure above. The term <em>many configurations</em> can be interpreted as a solution space around the most optimum $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ with acceptable error in the learned mapping. Note that in figures to follow, the shaded ellipses represent the solution of individual tasks where as the overlapping region of multiple ellipses, marked by diagonal lines, represents the common solution space for all tasks.</p> <p>Let’s begin with a simple case of two tasks, task $\mathcal{A}$ and task $\mathcal{B}$. To have a configuration of parameters that performs well for both $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, the network should be able to pick $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ from the overlapping region of the individual solution spaces (see Figure 2). This is with the assumption that there is always an overlapping region for the solution spaces of all tasks for the network to learn them sequentially. A case of four tasks has been illustrated in Figure 2. In the first instance, the network can learn any \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\mathcal{A}}\) that performs well for task $\mathcal{A}$. But with the arrival of task $\mathcal{B}$, the network should pick up a \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}}\).</p> <p>The next question that arrives is how can the network learn the a set of parameters that lies in this overlapping region. To this end, EWC presents a method of selective regularization of parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. After learning $\mathcal{A}$, this regularization method identifies which parameters are important for $\mathcal{A}$, and then penalizes any change made to the network parameters according to their importance while learning $\mathcal{B}$.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="75%" height="auto" title="Overlap of possible configurations of θ*" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Overlap of possible configurations of</strong> $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$.

More specifically given the data $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, we want to learn the posterior probability distribution function $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})$. Following <d-cite key="lherranz2018rotating"></d-cite> and using Bayes rule, we can write</p> <p>\begin{equation} \underbrace{p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})}_{\text{posterior}} = \dfrac{\overbrace{p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})}^{\text{likelihood}}\overbrace{p(\boldsymbol{\theta})}^{\text{prior}}}{p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})} \end{equation}</p> <p>Since maximizing a function is same as maximizing its logarithm, we take \(\log(\cdot)\) of the above equation as follows:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) +\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta})) - \log(p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) \end{equation}</p> <p>To train the neural network on $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, the objective function to be optimized over the log-likelihood function:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \text{argmax}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma}))} \end{equation}</p> <p>For the case of given two independent tasks such that \(\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}\}\) (with $\mathcal{B}$ appearing in sequence after $\mathcal{A}$), the log-posterior can be written as:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) +\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})) - \log(p(\mathcal{B})) \end{equation} where the independence of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is used. Following the Bayesian formulation, $p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the loss for current task $\mathcal{B}$, $p(\mathcal{B})$ is the likelihood for $\mathcal{B}$, and now posterior $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$ for $\mathcal{A}$ becomes prior for $\mathcal{B}$.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Laplace approximation of true posterior pdf" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Laplace approximation of true posterior pdf.</strong> $\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}$ represents the Fisher Information matrix. </div> <p>Referring to the log-posterior equation, it can be observed that we have to deal with the function $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$. This is the posterior function for $\mathcal{A}$ which contains the information about the parameters that explain $\mathcal{A}$ using the given network. As discussed in <d-cite key="kirkpatrick2017overcoming"></d-cite>, this posterior function is said to be intractable. Basically, the intractability of $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$ can be interpreted as the function not existing in some interpretable form. Hence, it is difficult to estimate its quantiles. See <d-cite key="tokdar2013lecture"></d-cite> for an example.</p> <p>Next as the posterior is difficult to analyze in its present form, we aim to approximate it using Laplace approximation. In simple terms, Laplace approximation methodology is employed to find a normal distribution approximation to a continuous probability density distribution (see Figure 3). Assuming $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$ is smooth and majorly peaked around its point of maxima (i.e. $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$), we can approximate it with a normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$ and variance $[\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}]^{-1}$. This brings us to the question on how did we come to the conclusion on these particular values of mean and variance for the normal distribution.</p> <p>To begin with, compute the second order Taylor expansion of $\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ around $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$ as follows:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) +( \dfrac{\partial\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top(\dfrac{\partial^2\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \text{(higher order terms)} \end{equation}</p> <p>Neglecting higher order terms and noting that \(\dfrac{\partial\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}} = 0\) (slope of tangent at peak), we have:</p> \[\begin{align} \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top\underbrace{(\dfrac{\partial^2\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})}_{\text{Hessian}}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) \end{align}\] <p>Using the log-posterior equation, we can write the above for task $\mathcal{A}$ as following:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})) = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}\mid\mathcal{A})) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top(\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \Delta \end{equation}</p> <p>where \(\Delta = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}\mid\mathcal{A}))\). Next, write</p> <p>\begin{equation} (\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}) = -((-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})^{-1})^{-1} \end{equation}</p> <p>and replace it back in the equation to express the same in the standard form of normal distribution function:</p> <p>\begin{equation} p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A}) = \epsilon\exp(-\dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top((-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})^{-1})^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})) \end{equation}</p> <p>where \(\epsilon = \exp(\Delta)\) is a constant. From this equation, it can be concluded that we have obtained the Laplace approximation of posterior pdf as:</p> <p>\begin{equation} p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})\sim\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}, (-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})^{-1}) \end{equation}</p> <p>Notice the variance of the estimated normal distribution of $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$. Given $\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$, the term $\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A}))$ represents the log-likelihood of posterior pdf $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$. Clearly, the term represents the inverse of <strong>Fisher information matrix</strong> (FIM),</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathbb{E}[-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}] \end{equation}\] <p>Note that we obtain $\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}$ by using the Bayesian equation and treating the prior $p(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and $p(\mathcal{A})$ constant. This makes derivative of log of the Bayesian equation posterior and likelihood equal. More on this in <strong>Appendix A.2</strong> of <d-cite key="van2019three"></d-cite>. Finally, we get</p> <p>\begin{equation} p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})\sim\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}, [\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}]^{-1}) \end{equation}</p> <p>Further, as FIM can also be computed from first order derivatives, we can avoid the Hessian computed in the Taylor expansion using the following property <d-cite key="kay1993fundamentals"></d-cite>:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathbb{E}[-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}] = \mathbb{E}[(\dfrac{\partial(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}})(\dfrac{\partial(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}})^\top\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}] \end{equation}\] <p>Now, we can write the log-posterior equation as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) +\dfrac{\lambda}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top(\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \epsilon' \end{equation}\] <p>where $\epsilon’$ accounts for all constants and $\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter introduced to have a trade off between learning $\mathcal{B}$ and not forgetting $\mathcal{A}$. Simplifying more, we have:</p> \[\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) - \dfrac{\lambda}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} - \boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}} (\boldsymbol{\theta} - \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \epsilon' \end{equation}\] <p>This implies: \(\begin{equation} \underbrace{\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}_{\text{overall loss}} = \underbrace{\ell_\mathcal{B}(\boldsymbol{\theta})}_{\text{loss for \mathcal{B} }} - \underbrace{\dfrac{\lambda}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})}_{\text{weight regularizer}} + \epsilon' \end{equation}\)</p> <p>Further simplification can be found in <d-cite key="van2019three"></d-cite>. Before we end this Section, let’s discuss how does the FIM indicates the <strong>importance</strong> of the parameters for the previous tasks.</p> <p>We say a network has learnt a task when its objective has reached a minimum in the loss surface. We know that the curvature of such surfaces represent the sensitivity of the network with respect to the optimum $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$. This sensitivity can be determined by looking at the direction along which $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$ changes. This implies the curvature is inversely proportional to change in $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$. Hence, if the more the curvature, a ‘$\delta$’ increment can result in large increase in the loss. Curvature of a curve is denoted by its Hessian and hence in our case, as the second derivative is of the log likelihood function of the posterior pdf, the FIM \(\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}\) comes into picture. Thus, \(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}\) can tell us which parameter is important to the the previous task as its corresponding element in \(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}\) will have a large value, indicating higher importance.
