They work by learning to reverse a gradual noising process. In a <strong>Forward Pass</strong> the data modality is progressively corrupted with gaussian noise until it becomes complete noise. In the <strong>Reverse process</strong> the model learns a denoiser which start from a gaussian noise and denoise this step-by-step to get an apprxomately clean sample. While this framework has proven to be quite effective, the existing works treats the noise as spatially uniform gaussian noise \(\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)\).</p> <p>The modalities mentioned above have one thing in common. They exibits <strong>power law</strong> in their Fouries representation. That is, the low-frequency components have orders of magnitude higher variance than high-frequency components <d-cite key="vanHateren1992"></d-cite>. To interpret the fourier component through visual representation, we can say low frequencies capture the global structure while the high frequency encodes the finer details. On viewing diffusion though the fouries lens of the data, it has an important implications: The DDPM forward process noises high-frequency components substantially earlier and faster as compared to the low frequency components. This can be attributed to the fact that Gaussian noise is applied irrespective of the data’s spectral content as we show later.</p> <p>Since the introduced Gaussian noise is agnostic to the data’s spectral characteristics, the forward process thereby imposes a hierarchy of frequencies during generation. As the higher frequencies are noised earler and faster in the forward process, and DDPM learns to reverse this forward process: during backward process the higher frequencies are generated later conditioned on the forward process as we see in Figure 3. Previous works has also observed this phenomenon of imposed hierarchy of frequencies during generation<d-cite key="falck2025fourierspaceperspectivediffusion"></d-cite></p> <p>Images aren’t spectrally flat. Natural images concentrate most of their power in lower frequencies following characteristic power-law distributions, while images from domains like Astronomy, Texture Design have varied concentration of pwer across the frequency bands. This raises a fundamental question: if datasets have inherent frequency biases and the denoising trajectory naturally progresses from coarse-to-fine structure, why do we apply the same uniform white noise at every timestep and across all frequencies? How does this same uniform white noise across all frequencies perform across images form varied domain? Our research asks whether we can explicitly shape the noise spectrum to (i) match each dataset’s actual frequency distribution and (ii) implement a principled time-frequency annealing schedule—shifting from low to high frequencies as denoising progresses—to improve sample quality and training stability without modifying the underlying UNet architecture or DDPM objective.</p> <h2 id="quick-overview">Quick Overview</h2> <p>Let’s start with a quick overview of the two frameworks we will be working with: Diffusion models and Frequency domain of Images.</p> <h3 id="diffusion-models">Diffusion Models</h3> <p>Diffusion models generate data by learning to reverse a gradual noising process. The core idea is elegantly simple: start with real data and progressively corrupt it by adding Gaussian noise over many steps until it becomes pure random noise. This forward process requires no learning and follows a predefined schedule. A neural network then learns to invert this process, starting from random noise and iteratively denoising it to recover clean, structured data. This reverse process is governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that describe how probability distributions evolve over time, with the model learning to approximate the score function which guides the denoising steps.</p> <h3 id="forward-process">Forward Process</h3> <p>It defines a markov chain that progressively add gaussian noise to the data sample \(\mathbf{x}_0 \sim q(\mathbf{x}_0)\) over \(T\) timesteps. Each timestep adds a slight noise to the data resulting in a increasingly noisy samples \(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_T\), where $\mathbf{x}_T$ approximates an isotropic Gaussian distribution. The forward process is formally defined as :</p> \[q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} \, \mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I}),\] <p>where $\beta_t \in (0,1)$ controls the amount of noise added to the data.</p> <p>By applying the reparameterization reccursively we obtain the closed form experssion</p> \[q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_0) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \, \mathbf{x}_0, (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t)\mathbf{I}),\] <p>where \(\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t\) and \(\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^t \alpha_s\).</p> <p>Thus the noisy data at any given time \(t\) in the forward proccess</p> \[\mathbf{x}_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\mathbf{x}_0 + \sqrt{(1 - \bar{\alpha}_t)}\epsilon\] <p>where \(\epsilon \in \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})\).</p> <p>A useful notation in this is the log signal-to-noise ratio \(\lambda_t = log(\bar{\alpha}_t / (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t))\) which increases monotonically from 0 ( clean data) to 1 (noise)</p> <h3 id="reverse-process">Reverse Process</h3> <p>The Reverse process tries to invert the forward process, transforming Gaussian noise \(\mathbf{x}_T \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})\) back into a data sample resembling the data distribution \(q(\mathbf{x}_0)\). Since the true reverse transitions \(q(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t)\) are intractable, a parameterized model \(p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t)\) is trained to approximate them.</p> <p>The reverse process is modeled as:</p> \[p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t)),\] <p>where \(\boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta\) and \(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta\) are outputs of a neural network conditioned on \(\mathbf{x}_t\) and the timestep \(t\). The model learns to predict the mean of the denoised sample at each step.</p> <p>Using the forward process derivation, the true mean of \(q(\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_0)\) can be expressed as:</p> \[\boldsymbol{\mu}_q(\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( \mathbf{x}_t - \frac{\beta_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \right),\] <p>where \(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\) denotes the Gaussian noise added at timestep \(t\).</p> <p>On way of learning is during training the model is optimized to predict this noise directly using a loss of the form:</p> \[L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{x}_0, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}} \left[ \left\| \boldsymbol{\epsilon} - \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_\theta( \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\mathbf{x}_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}, t ) \right\|^2 \right],\] <p>which corresponds to a reweighted variational bound on the data likelihood.</p> <h3 id="fouries-domain">Fouries Domain</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/image_fft-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/image_fft-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/image_fft-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/image_fft.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/power_law-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/power_law-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/power_law-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/power_law.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure2: First two image shows an image in spatial, in frequency domain. The plot is the log-log plot of Power spectral density and Frequency of the image. </div> <p>Natural Images have rich structures in the frequency domain that is obscured in the pixel space. Understanding this frequency domain perspective is crucial for our investigation.</p> <p>Let’s say we have an image \(x \in \mathbf{R}_{H \times W\times C}\). Its pixels are coeffcient of a standard basis \(\mathcal{B} = \{ \mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \dots, \mathbf{e}_n \} \subset \mathbb{R}^n\). In the spatial domain, the image is defined as a linear combination of standard basis vectors, where each pixel represents a local real-valued intensity. When we apply the Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) to this image, it performs unitary change of basis giving us the frequency domain equivalent of the image. The dimension of the fourier and the pixel image remains the same but in fourier domain the coefficients of the basis becomes complex valued.</p> <p>For each channel of an image the DFT can be formulated as</p> \[F(u, v) = \sum_{x=0}^{H-1} \sum_{y=0}^{W-1} f(x, y) e^{-j 2\pi \left( \frac{ux}{H} + \frac{vy}{W} \right)}\] <p>where \((u,v)\) aer spatial frequency indices. The radial frequency \(f = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}\) measure the distance from the DC ( zero frequency component)</p> <p>Now, let’s sort the Fourier coeeficient \(f(u,v)\) from low to high frequency. To do so, we start from the center of our Fourier Space and walk in spirals. That is, sort them using the Manhatten distancen of the indices \((uv,)\) from the center (0,0) of the Fourier representation. From the Figure 2 It’s very evident that signal variance decreases rapidly with increasing frquency. <d-cite key="dielman"></d-cite> shows that similar trend is visible in other doains (Videos, Audio, Proteins) as well.</p> <p><strong>Power Spectral Density(PSD)</strong>: This quantifies how the signal enery is distributed across frequencies. For an image with Fourier Transform \(F(u,v)\), PSD is defined as :</p> \[P(u,v) = |F(u,v)|^2\] <p>representing the power at each frequency component. To get one dimensional spectral profile we compute the radially-average PSD by integrating over annular regions at constant radial frequency \(f\) (simply put we compute average power in ring-shaped zones moving outward from the center). Formally put</p> \[P(f) = \frac{1}{|B_f|} \sum{}_{(u,v) \in B_f} |F(u,v)|^2\] <p>Where \(B_f\) is the radial frequency band defined as \(B_f = {(u,v): f \leq \sqrt{u^2+v^2} \le f+ \delta f}\) and \(\|B_f\|\) is the number of frequencies in that band.</p> <p>The PSD reveals how much each frequency contributes to the overall signal. For a dataset of images, we compute per-image PSDs and average them to obtain a dataset-level spectral profile. This aggregate PSD characterizes the typical frequency distribution of the data and captures domain-specific properties</p> <p>Real-world image datasets exhibit characteristic frequency distributions. The power spectral density of natural images typically follows a power-law decay:</p> \[P \propto f^{-\alpha}\] <p>Emperical studies on natural image statistics shave shown that \(\alpha\) typically resides in the interval \([1,3]\) <d-cite key="field,physrevLett"> </d-cite>.

This is acomplished by applying the Fourier transform \(\mathbf{F}\) to the variable \(x_t\)</p> \[y_t : \mathbf{F}\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{F}\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\mathbf{x}_0 + \mathbf{F}\sqrt{(1 - \bar{\alpha}_t)}\epsilon\] <p>Here, \(y_t\) is our fourier-transformed intermediate step at time step \(t\) of the forward process.</p> <p>Taking the quantification of Signal-to-noise Ration from <d-cite key="falck2025fourierspaceperspectivediffusion"></d-cite>, where SNR of \((x_t)_i\) is the signal to noise ration of frquescy \(i\) at timestep \(t\). Formally put</p> \[SNR((x_t)_i) = \frac{\bar{\alpha_t}\varsigma_i}{1-\bar{\alpha_t}}\] <p>Where \(\varsigma_i = Var((x_0)_i)\) represents the signal variance of requency \(i\).</p> <p>Tying these all together, we see in Figure 3, that standard DDPM corrupts high-frequencies faster than low frequencies. This bias is carry forwarded to the reverse process as well.</p> <p>Thus we want to study an alternate noising schedule that respects the datasets spectral signature. To put simply a Frequency Adaptive Noise Scheduler ( FANS ).</p> <h2 id="fans">FANS</h2> <p>In the previous sections we saw the inductive bias of DDPM towards high frequency components both in forward and reverse process. We want to investigate if instead of isotropic gaussian noise scheduler (irrespective of the frequency distribution of the dataset), we use a scheduler that is adaptive to the intrinsic frequency characteristic of the dataset by constructing spectrally-shaped noise. Our key insight is that different frequency bands contribute unequally to perceptual quality and should be treated accordingly during both training and generation.</p> <p>This proposed approach, operates through three complementary mechanism :</p> <ol> <li><strong>Dataset importance profiling</strong>: We analyze the spectraal distribution of the data to compute frequency band importance weight \(g_b\) that quantifies the relative contribution of each band of the overall data.</li> <li><strong>Time-Frequency Scheduling</strong>: We introduce a temporal ramping function \(\phi(t)\) that smoothly transitions noise allocation from low to high frequencies as the diffusion process evolves, enabling coarse-to-fine generation.</li> <li><strong>Variance-Compensated Weighting</strong>: We apply inverse-power weighting to band importances, ensuring that underrepresented high-frequency bands receive compensatory emphasis during training.</li> </ol> <p>We can now formalize these mechanism:</p> <h3 id="radial-frequency-band-decomposition">Radial Frequency Band Decomposition</h3> <p>Recalling from previous discussion, let’s \(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C}\) denote a clean image, and let \(\mathcal{F}\) denote the real-valued FFT used in the implementation. To characterise the dataset’s spectral structure, we partition the \(B\) radial frequency bands \(\{B_b\}_{b=1}^B\) in the discrete \(r\)FFT layout (shape \(H \times W/2 + 1\)) using linear radial boundaries. For each band \(b\) we define :</p> <ul> <li><strong>Band mask</strong> : \(B_b \in \{0,1\}^{H \times W/2 + 1}\) indicating membership.</li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Band size</strong> :</td> <td>\(B_b\)</td> <td>denotes the nuber of frequency coefficients in band \(b\).</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> </ul> <p>Bands are constructed using radial frequency \(F(u,v) = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}\) with edges uniformly spaced between a small positive \(f_{min}\) (to exclude DC component) and \(f_{mac}\) ( Nyquist frequency = 0.5)</p> <p><strong>Intuition</strong> : Excluding the DC component (zero frequency) is critical because it represents the global mean intensity, which dominates the spectrum but carries minimal perceptual information. Including DC in band 0 would artificially inflate its importance \(g_0\) and distort the learned weighting.</p> <h3 id="dataset-importance-profiling">Dataset Importance Profiling</h3> <p>For each image \(x\) in the training set, we compute the <strong>normalized band power</strong> \(\pi_b(x)\) as ;</p> \[\pi_b(x) = \frac{\sum{}_{k \in B_b} |F(x - \bar{x})(k)|^2 }{\sum^{B-1}_{b^\prime = 0 }\sum{}_{k \in B_{b^\prime}} |F(x - \bar{x})(k)|^2 }\] <p>wher \(\bar{x}\) is the per image mean ( removing DC ). This gives the fraction of total power residing in band \(b\) for image \(x\).</p> <p>We then compute the dataset-level band distribution by averaging over \(N\) samples:</p> \[\bar{\pi} = \frac{1}{N} \sum^{N}_{i=1} \pi_b(x_i)\] <p>Note that \(\sum^{B-1}_{b=0} \bar{\pi_b} = 1\) by construction.</p> <p>Finally, we compute importance weights via inverse-power scaling rule :</p> \[g_b = \frac{(\bar{\pi_b} + \epsilon )^{-\alpha}}{\frac{1}{B}\sum^{B-1}_{b^\prime=0}(\bar{\pi_{b^\prime}} + \epsilon)^{-\alpha}}\] <p>wher \(\alpha\) controls the strength of variance compensation. The standardization ensures \(g_b\) has zero mean and unit variance, provising a stable range for the softmax reweighting.</p> <p><strong>Intuition</strong>: Bands with low power \(\bar{\pi_b}\)(e.g., high frequencies) receive higher importance \(g_b\) ​, compensating for their underrepresentation in the data. This prevents the model from neglecting high-frequency reconstruction.</p> <h3 id="time-dependent-soft-band-weighting-check-once">Time-Dependent Soft Band Weighting [check once]</h3> <p>At each timestep \(t∈[0,1]\)t \in [0,1]\(, we compute soft band weights\)w_b(t)$$ via a temperature-scaled softmax with time-frequency ramping:</p> \[w_b(t) = \frac{exp(\beta.g_b - \gamma.\phi(t).\lambda_b)}{\sum^{B-1}_{b^\prime = 0}exp(\beta.g_b^\prime - \gamma.\phi(t).\lambda_b^\prime)}\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>\(\lambda_b = b/(B-1)\) is the normalized band index \(\lambda_0 = 0, \lambda_{B-1}=1\)</li> <li>\(\pi(t) \in [0,1]\) is a temporal ramp.</li> <li>\(\beta,\gamma \ge 0\) are the invese temperature hyperparameter.</li> </ul> <p>Early in the diffusion process, the term \(\beta. g_b\) dominates, emphasizing frequencies according to dataset statistics. As \(t\) increases, the ramp \(\phi(t)\) gradually increases the influence of $\gamma\lambda_b$, making the spectrum increasingly uniform.</p> <p><strong>Stabilization: White Noise Guardrail</strong> To ensure stable training during the earliest timesteps, we introduce a white noise mixing schedule:</p> \[w_b^{\text{mix}}(t) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{B} &amp; \text{if } t &lt; t_{\text{knee}} \\ (1 - \alpha_{\text{mix}}(t)) \cdot \frac{1}{B} + \alpha_{\text{mix}}(t) \cdot w_b(t) &amp; \text{if } t \geq t_{\text{knee}} \end{cases}\] <p>where \(\alpha_{\text{mix}}(t) = \frac{t - t_{\text{knee}}}{1 - t_{\text{knee}}}\)​​ is a linear blend coefficient and \(t_{\text{knee}} = 0.15\) by default.</p> <p><strong>Intuition</strong>: At very small \(t\), the noised samples \(x_t \approx \beta_t \epsilon\) are nearly pure noise. Enforcing strong spectral shaping here can destabilize training because the model has insufficient signal to learn meaningful structure. By using uniform weights early, we ensure the model first learns to denoise white noise (as in standard DDPM), then gradually transitions to FANS-shaped noise.</p> <h3 id="fans-noise-generation">FANS Noise Generation</h3> <p>Tying the above mechanisms together to generate the FANS-Noise we get.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_training-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_training-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_training-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_training.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Given a sample \(x \in \mathcal{R}^{N \times C \times H \times W}\) and normalised time \(t \in [0,1]\) FANS-Noise \(\epsilon_{FANS}\) is generated as :</p> <p>Step 1. <strong>Compute band weights:</strong> \(\{w_b(t)\}^{B-1}_{b=0}\) as discussed above.

By Parseval’s theorem</p> \[\sum_{i=1}^{H \cdot W} x_i^2 = \frac{1}{H \cdot W} \sum_{k} |F(x)(k)|^2\] <p>where the factor \(1/(H \cdot W)\) comes from the DFT normalization convention.</p> <p>We then allocate power to each band according to the learned weights:</p> \[P_b(t) = w_b(t) \cdot P_{\text{total}} = w_b(t) \cdot H \cdot W\] <p>The per-frequency variance within band \(b\) is obtained by distributing \(P_b\)​ uniformly across its members:</p> \[\Sigma_b(t) = \frac{P_b(t)}{|\mathcal{B}_b| + \epsilon}\] <p>where \(\epsilon = 10^{-6}\) prevents division by zero as a numerical safeguard.</p> <p>Step 3. <strong>Draw Complex Gaussian Noise in Fourier Space</strong>:</p> <p>We generate base noise \(Z \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times C \times H \times (W/2+1)}\) by sampling independent real and imaginary components:</p> \[Z_{\text{real}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I), \quad Z_{\text{imag}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\] \[Z(n, c, h, w) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(Z_{\text{real}}(n,c,h,w) + i \cdot Z_{\text{imag}}(n,c,h,w))\] <p>The \(1/\sqrt{2}\)​ factor ensures</p> \[\mathbb{E}[|Z(k)|^2] = \mathbb{E}[Z_{\text{real}}^2 + Z_{\text{imag}}^2]/2 = 1\] <p>Step 4: <strong>Construct Spectral Variance Mask</strong></p> <p>We build a spatial variance map \(\Sigma_t \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C \times H \times (W/2+1)}\)that specifies the desired variance at each frequency:</p> \[\Sigma_t(n,c,h,w) = \sum_{b=0}^{B-1} \Sigma_b(t) \cdot \mathbb{1}_{(h,w) \in \mathcal{B}_b}\] <p>where \(\mathbb{1}_{(h,w) \in \mathcal{B}_b}\)​​ is the indicator function for band membership.</p> <p>Step 5: <strong>Apply Frequency-Dependent Scaling</strong> The shaped noise in Fourier space is obtained by element-wise multiplication:</p> \[E_{\text{shaped}}(n,c,h,w) = \sqrt{\Sigma_t(n,c,h,w) + \epsilon_{\text{safe}}} \cdot Z(n,c,h,w)\] <p>where \(\epsilon_{\text{safe}} = 10^{-12}\) ensures numerical stability when \(\Sigma_t \approx 0\).</p> <p>Why square root? We are scaling the amplitude of Fourier coefficients. Since power is amplitude squared, to achieve variance \(\Sigma_t(k)\), we need amplitude \(\sqrt{\Sigma_t(k)}\)​. This follows from:</p> \[\mathbb{E}[|E_{\text{shaped}}(k)|^2] = \mathbb{E}[|\sqrt{\Sigma_t(k)} \cdot Z(k)|^2] = \Sigma_t(k) \cdot \mathbb{E}[|Z(k)|^2] = \Sigma_t(k)\] <p>Step 6: <strong>Inverse Fourier Transform to Pixel Space</strong> We apply the inverse real FFT to recover a real-valued noise image:</p> \[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^{\text{raw}} = \text{irfft2d}(E_{\text{shaped}}, s=(H, W))\] <p>where \(s=(H, W)\) specifies the desired output shape and irfft2d is the 2D inverse real FFT.</p> <p>Step 7: <strong>Enforce Unit Variance via Normalization</strong> While the Fourier-space construction theoretically preserves variance, discretization effects, numerical precision, and band edge artifacts can cause the pixel-space variance to deviate from unity. To ensure exact compatibility with the forward process \(x_t = \alpha_t z + \beta_t \epsilon\) where \(\mathbb{E}[\epsilon \epsilon^T] = I\), we enforce unit variance per sample and per channel:</p> \[\mu(n,c) = \frac{1}{H \cdot W} \sum_{h,w} \epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^{\text{raw}}(n,c,h,w)\] \[\sigma^2(n,c) = \frac{1}{H \cdot W} \sum_{h,w} (\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^{\text{raw}}(n,c,h,w) - \mu(n,c))^2\] \[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}(n,c,h,w) = \frac{\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^{\text{raw}}(n,c,h,w) - \mu(n,c)}{\sqrt{\sigma^2(n,c) + \epsilon_{\text{safe}}}}\] <p>Critical importance: This normalization is not optional. Without it, we observed training instabilities where the effective noise magnitude drifted over time, breaking the assumptions of the forward SDE. The normalization ensures:</p> <ul> <li>Zero mean: \(\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}] = 0\) exactly (not just approximately)</li> <li>Unit variance: \(\text{Var}(\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}) = I\) exactly</li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Consistency: \(x_t = \alpha_t z + \beta_t \epsilon_{\text{FANS}}\)​ has the correct conditional distribution $$p_t(x</td> <td>z)$$</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> </ul> <p>Why per-channel normalization? Color channels may have different effective powers after Fourier shaping due to:</p> <ul> <li>Boundary effects in rFFT (asymmetric handling of Nyquist)</li> <li>Floating-point rounding errors accumulated differently per channel</li> <li>Non-uniform distribution of salient features across RGB</li> </ul> <p>Normalizing each channel independently ensures that the model sees noise with identical statistics in all color channels, preventing the network from learning color-dependent denoising biases.</p> <p>Step 8: <strong>Return Shaped Noise</strong> The final output \(\epsilon_{\text{FANS}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C \times H \times W}\) satisfies:</p> <ol> <li>\(\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}}] = 0\)(zero mean)</li> <li>\(\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{\text{FANS}} \epsilon_{\text{FANS}}^T] = I\) (unit covariance)</li> <li>Frequency band \(b\) contains fraction \(\approx w_b(t)\) of total power</li> </ol> <p>Low frequencies dominate at small \(t\), high frequencies at large \(t\)</p> <p>This noise can now be used in the forward process:</p> \[x_t = \alpha_t z + \beta_t \epsilon_{\text{FANS}}\] <p>and in the loss computation:</p> \[\mathcal{L} = \|u_\theta^t(x_t) - (\dot{\alpha}_t z + \dot{\beta}_t \epsilon_{\text{FANS}})\|^2\] <h3 id="sampling-inference">Sampling/ Inference</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_sampling-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_sampling-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_sampling-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-11-25-fans/fans_sampling.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>This algorithm shows the sampling method we used for our proposed approach.</p> <p>Now that we have the mechanism to get spectral aware shape, we need to see how performs against a baseline.

By leveraging the spectral characteristics of training data to construct frequency-dependent noise distributions, FANS enables models to allocate denoising capacity more efficiently across the frequency spectrum. Through rigorous experiments on synthetic datasets with known spectral characteristics (PLTB and EGM), we demonstrate that FANS consistently improves sample quality compared to vanilla DDPM baselines, particularly for datasets with pronounced high-frequency content. The method’s ability to learn dataset-specific frequency priorities and dynamically adjust noise shaping over time represents a meaningful step toward more adaptive and efficient diffusion training.</p> <p>However, our work also reveals important limitations and directions for future investigation. In the current implementation the computational overhead of spectral profiling and per-sample noise generation, while manageable, adds complexity to the training pipeline.</p> <p>Future work should focus on several key areas: extending FANS to high-resolution natural images and validating its benefits on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, exploring integration with modern architectures like diffusion transformers, and investigating the interplay between FANS and other recent advances such as flow matching and consistency models. Additionally, theoretical analysis of FANS’s convergence properties and its relationship to other forms of adaptive noise scheduling would strengthen the mathematical foundations of the approach.</p> <p>Despite these challenges, FANS demonstrates that incorporating dataset-specific spectral information into the noise generation process can meaningfully improve diffusion model training. As the field continues to push toward higher-resolution, higher-fidelity generation, methods that efficiently allocate model capacity across frequency bands will become increasingly important. We hope this work inspires further exploration of adaptive, data-driven approaches to noise scheduling in generative models.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet they often struggle with spectral bias,the tendency to prioritize low-frequency patterns while inadequately learning high-frequency details. This limitation stems from the uniform noise scheduling employed during training, which allocates equal denoising capacity across all frequencies regardless of the dataset's spectral characteristics. We introduce Frequency-Adaptive Noise Shaping (FANS), a principled framework that addresses this fundamental limitation by dynamically shaping noise distributions according to dataset-specific frequency importance. FANS operates on a simple insight - different datasets exhibit distinct spectral signatures, and noise scheduling should reflect these differences. The framework integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion architectures through a simple modification to the noise sampling procedure during training and inference.We validate FANS on synthetic datasets with controlled spectral properties as well as real world data (CIFAR10, CelebA, Texture, MultimodalUniverse) where we demonstrate consistent improvements over vanilla DDPM baselines. Our experiments reveal that FANS particularly excels on high-frequency-rich datasets, producing sharper, more detailed samples while maintaining comparable performance for standard natural image datasets like CIFAR10 and CelebA.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Beyond the Rerun: Why Reproducibility is Failing Science</title><link href="https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2026/blog/2026/beyond-the-rerun/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Beyond the Rerun: Why Reproducibility is Failing Science"/><published>2026-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2026-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2026/blog/2026/beyond-the-rerun</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2026/blog/2026/beyond-the-rerun/"><![CDATA[<p>I see other students in my research group struggling and spending weeks trying to replicate experiments that have already been done and for which the code is already available. And I ask myself, what could we do to make it better for them and other researchers? It should be as easy as “just run the experiment program”, right? But even when code is available and runnable, significant friction remains.</p> <h2 id="but-why-does-it-matter-if-someone-can-run-your-research-code-easily">But, why does it matter if someone can run your research code easily?</h2> <p>Reproducibility, the ability to repeat an experiment, given its code and obtain the same results, is vital to scientific construction. Following Popper’s line of thought <d-cite key="KarlPopperStanford"></d-cite>, science depends on hypotheses and statements that can be tested and falsified. Without reproducibility, such testing becomes difficult for critical argumentation, which weakens scientific claims, even if it does not directly invalidate them.</p> <p>Today, there is a “reproducibility crisis” in science <d-cite key="baker1500ScientistsLift2016"></d-cite>. Interestingly, physicists and engineers are among those who say their work is more reproducible, while more than 60% have had problems reproducing others’ experiments. This contradiction highlights a clear reproducibility problem that impacts the quality of the scientific knowledge generated, while its causes may not be as clear. One possible reason for this is over-reliance on computers, which scientists see as precise entities that execute “precise” algorithms, but whose reproducibility ultimately depends on their proper execution of those programs <d-cite key="plesserReproducibilityVsReplicability2018"></d-cite>. From another perspective, the pressure to publish ranks second among the causes of irreproducibility, diminishing the quality of scientific code and its usability.</p> <p>There are initiatives to improve the issue of reproducibility. The “AI4Europe Reproducibility Initiative” <d-cite key="AI4EuropeReproducibilityInitiative"></d-cite> focuses on three different barriers to reproducibility: technical, the documentation and preservation of software and data; cultural, the encouragement and valuation of reproducibility over results and novelty alone; and systemic, the lack of standards and guidelines for reproducibility. Conferences also address the issue, with ICLR incentivizing a reproducibility statement <d-cite key="ICLR2026Author"></d-cite> and NeurIPS <d-cite key="NeurIPS2025Call"></d-cite> including a mandatory reproducibility question in its checklist. There are even awards for studies that best address reproducibility <d-cite key="GENEAWorkshop2025"></d-cite>. NeurIPS also suggests using the Papers With Code guidelines <d-cite key="PaperswithcodeReleasingresearchcode2025"></d-cite>, which include requirements such as a requirements list, Docker images uploaded to Docker Hub, separate code for training and evaluation, pre-trained models, and instructions for reproducing the results. As outlined in this guideline, not only the code but also sharing other artifacts are essential, as one can say, “Where re-running is successful, the published artifacts allow others to build on earlier work” <d-cite key="plesserReproducibilityVsReplicability2018"></d-cite>.</p> <p>However, we argue that reproducibility alone is not enough for science. Science is about questioning and proposing new perspectives and approaches, about advancing the SotA. It’s not enough to simply be able to re-execute and understand a project. It needs to be possible to use it and build upon it, because that’s how science is built. Often, “reproducible” code is a black box that runs in a Docker container, spits out a number, and dies. If I can’t dissect the model to understand <em>why</em> it worked, that is performance validation, not knowledge building. And the current view, focused solely on the reproducibility crisis, fails to see this resulting gap. When we ask our students to replicate an experiment published by other researchers, we want them to understand it and be able to propose changes and new approaches based on it.</p> <p>We have a proliferation of “single-use codes,” and that is not sustainable. Symptoms of the trap of prioritizing productivity over quality and scientific advancement include shortcuts to publishing quickly that, paradoxically, ultimately increase the overall time cost of science. We are creating a <strong>“scientific debt”</strong> that makes research more challenging. We have separated the code for a new method here from the code of the experiment performed to validate it, since the former should be the focus of this problem. Methods should be reusable and extensible, as significant advances in science have not been built upon single-use methods.</p> <h2 id="pillars-for-scientific-computer-science">Pillars for Scientific Computer Science</h2> <p>Building on the “scientific debt” presented, we propose to view the problem from three pillars, <strong>Reproducibility</strong>, <strong>Legibility</strong>, and <strong>Composability</strong>:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Reproducibility</strong></th> <th><strong>Readability</strong></th> <th><strong>Composability</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>The classical reproducibility view, which focuses on the ability to re-run an experiment, which we have discussed so far.</td> <td>The ability to interpret a project, understand how it works, and know how to use it. It’s about making a project transparent, no longer a black box.</td> <td>The possibility of creating something new using existing code. Being able to use SotA methods to advance science further.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>As mentioned, reproducibility is essential to the validity of science and the foundation of its quality; without it, the other pillars are useless. Readability, on the other hand, advances the field and enables a proper understanding of what is happening; without it, it becomes challenging to use previous results. Finally, composability is what most contributes to advancing science and should be the objective when designing research software.</p> <h2 id="from-scripts-to-building-blocks-a-path-forward">From Scripts to Building Blocks: A Path Forward</h2> <p>Let’s look at practical actions we can take to achieve the pillars. We will focus on scientific code written in Python, as it is the most widely used language in science today. We will include links to tutorials, tools, and specifications that may be useful.</p> <p>These are some recommendations that you, as a researcher, can use. But even though well-intentioned researchers can make incredible things; this is a problem we also need to address collectively, as we will discuss later.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Software design</strong></p> <p>We need software with designs considering the division of concerns. Currently, it’s very common to see programs that mix the code of the proposed method (method code) with the code of the experiment that validates the method and generates metrics and results (experiment code).</p> <p>Ideally, these codes should be decoupled, allowing the method to be reused in future research. The method code should also, whenever possible, be written using well-known, widely used frameworks, further increasing compatibility. Think about how easy it is to use a neural network layer that is already written in a ready-to-use PyTorch class. The experiment code should contain not only the code to run the experiment, but also its configurations and the code responsible for processing datasets. Furthermore, it should include clear execution entry points, avoiding the need to run different scripts in different folders to perform a single task, such as training or evaluating a model.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Code standards</strong></p> <p>A consistent coding style throughout the project is important for ease of understanding. Writing variable, function, and class names in a way that clearly explains what they do is a good starting point.</p> <p>Some practices make code significantly easier to understand—for example, avoiding very long functions or files, keeping imports at the top of each file, and reducing the use of large configuration dictionaries passed through the code.</p> <p>There are tools, like AutoPEP8 <d-cite key="Autopep8ToolThat"></d-cite><d-cite key="Autopep8VisualStudio"></d-cite>, that automatically formats code using the PEP 8 (official “Style Guide for Python Code”) guidelines <d-cite key="guidovanrossumPEP8Style"></d-cite>, and SonarLint <d-cite key="SonarQubeIDEVisual"></d-cite>, which can help maintain a consistent, appropriate style.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Documentation</strong></p> <p>In addition to following good coding standards, it’s important to write clear documentation alongside the code that explains what each section of code does. This can include comments in more complex areas and, at least, function docstrings. Type annotations <d-cite key="TypeHintsPython21"></d-cite><d-cite key="TypingSupportType"></d-cite> are also part of this group; in addition to being used by functions for auto-completion of parts of docstrings, they also facilitate code usage by allowing autocomplete and visualization of the appropriate documentation while writing new code.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Version control</strong></p> <p>Versioning your project helps future researchers find the specific version associated with a published result. It also facilitates collaborative development among different researchers and makes explicit the changes made over time.</p> <p>Version control should be applied to the codebase, but you can also use it for other artifacts, such as pre-trained models, Docker images, and datasets. Tools like git/GitHub for code, and Zenodo for other artifacts, make it easier to make artifacts available through versions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Publishing and distribution</strong></p> <p>Publishing your research software on a standard, user-friendly channel helps other researchers utilize your contribution in future research. In Python, this usually means packaging your method and distributing it using PyPI (Python Package Index) <d-cite key="PythonPackageIndex"></d-cite><d-cite key="PackagingPythonProjects"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Avoid expecting other researchers to copy your script into their projects. Besides being less straightforward, it doesn’t consider potential future versions and complicates issues like licensing. Imagine including the license for each library you used in your research in your repository.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dependencies specification</strong></p> <p>Specifying all the dependencies of your project is a first step in enabling a third party to reproduce your results or use your method.</p> <p>When distributing your method, avoid specifying fixed versions, as this will make it difficult to use with other packages. Specify the minimum versions your project supports. And use standard ways to specify dependencies, such as your project’s pyproject.toml file <d-cite key="WritingYourPyprojecttoml"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hardware specification</strong></p> <p>Specify what hardware you used to run your experiment, as well as the minimum requirements your method may need. This helps other researchers prepare environments to reproduce your results and further develop them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Containerization</strong></p> <p>Docker <d-cite key="WhatContainer0200"></d-cite>, like other container tools, allows other researchers to use the environment you used to conduct your experiments directly. This makes it much easier to reproduce your results and use your method, since all dependencies will be identical to yours. In addition to making the dockerfile you created for your image available, also consider making your built image available on Docker Hub <d-cite key="DockerHubContainer"></d-cite> or Zenodo <d-cite key="PauleveDonodoBridging"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tutorials</strong></p> <p>Write tutorials about your method. Besides providing a quick, straightforward introduction that can serve as a first overview and gateway to more in-depth publications, it helps others get started using your method. Jupyter Notebook <d-cite key="grangerJupyterThinkingStorytelling2021"></d-cite><d-cite key="ProjectJupyter"></d-cite> is a suitable format for tutorials.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Licensing</strong></p> <p>It’s pointless to make your project available if others can’t use it due to legal issues. Licensing is an integral part of allowing your method to be explored by other researchers. Several licenses, with different properties, are available. Please choose the one that best suits your project and use it correctly <d-cite key="ChooseOpenSource"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Remember that making code available without any license means being stuck in a limbo between “nobody can use it” and the contradiction of “I made it available on a platform like GitHub”. And there are specific licenses for each type of artifact. In particular, Creative Commons <d-cite key="CreativeCommons"></d-cite> licenses are not appropriate for code <d-cite key="CreativeCommonsFrequentlyAskedQuestions"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Persistence and traceability</strong></p> <p>Make your code and artifacts available in persistent repositories. Zenodo is a good example that automatically stores releases from GitHub repositories <d-cite key="ZenodoGitHubSoftware"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Also consider how these repositories can be found in the future. Referencing the DOI of these artifacts can facilitate their traceability in the future. For code on GitHub, consider making CFF files available with the project’s DOI <d-cite key="CITATIONFiles"></d-cite>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Let’s see how each indication relates to the pillars. Notice how reproducibility and composability are often closely related in practice:</p> <pre><code class="language-mermaid">%%{init: { "gantt": { "displayMode": "compact", "leftPadding":200 } }}%%

It responds politely in Japanese — but behind the scenes, it’s reasoning in English/Chinese. Variables, steps, and mathematical lemmas often silently switch languages during reasoning. This behavior, where models default to English for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, is more than a curiosity. It breaks instruction-following, confuses human overseers, and undermines the purpose of multilingual evaluation.</p> <p>The goal is clear: we want models to reason about a question in the language they are asked — not just to answer in that language. But this turns out to be harder than it sounds. Forcing models to reason in non-English languages usually leads to a drop in accuracy. Previous work shows that instructing models to reason only in the prompt language via prompting or steering improves coherence and grading alignment <d-cite key="zhong2025language"></d-cite>, but often comes at a steep “accuracy tax.” Even a small amount of multilingual fine-tuning helps, but doesn’t eliminate the trade-off <d-cite key="qi-etal-2025-models"></d-cite>. Further, models not only prefer to reason in English — they reason <em>more effectively</em> in English. When researchers force strict in-language reasoning (e.g., in Swahili or Thai), models often lose accuracy compared to when allowed to reason in English. For higher-resource languages like French or German, this trade-off is smaller — models can reason in-language nearly as well as in English. For low-resource languages, strict enforcement harms performance more significantly.</p> <p>Why do models switch to English in the first place? Much of it traces back to training. Most reasoning data are in English. Fine-tuning even strong multilingual models on English CoT data often leads them to adopt English as their “internal language of logic.” Yong et al. (2025) observe a “quote-and-think” behavior <d-cite key="yong2025crosslingual"></d-cite>, where models copy input phrases in the prompt language, but explain everything in English <d-cite key="kim2025one"></d-cite>. The model understands the question in the non-English language — it just prefers to reason in English.</p> <p>Our technical goal is simple: <strong>stop the switching without paying an accuracy tax</strong> — ideally, push the Pareto frontier of <em>(Accuracy, Language-consistency)</em>.<br/> And we want this post to serve as a practical guide with lessons learned along the way.</p> <p>Code, data, and checkpoints will be linked in the <strong>camera-ready</strong> version of this post to preserve anonymity during review.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="what-we-try-method-in-two-steps">What we try (Method in two steps)</h2> <p>🔧 <strong>Base model.</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</code>, a large reasoning model distilled from R1 through supervised fine-tuning on its reasoning traces, exhibiting an English/Chinese-dominant prior.</p> <p><strong>Step 1 — Small SFT to teach in-language reasoning.</strong><br/> We fine-tune on <strong>817 curated multilingual reasoning chains</strong> (from LiMO <d-cite key="ye2025limo"></d-cite>). This supervision data contains high-quality reasoning data matching R1 long-form reasoning <em>style</em>. No Reinforcement Learning (RL) here — just teach the policy to keep reasoning in the user’s query language.</p> <p><strong>Step 2 — Math-only GRPO to push accuracy while retaining reasoning language.</strong><br/> We run an RLVR-style GRPO with no KL, higher clip of 0.28 vs −0.2 (DAPO-like <d-cite key="yu2025dapo"></d-cite>), rollout 24, LoRA r = 8, LR = 1e-5, <strong>only on a Math-500 set translated to each language</strong>.<br/> Intuition: let RL optimize hard cases and verification behaviors, while the high clip reduces catastrophic reasoning style collapse back to English.</p> <p>We set the verifiable rewards as <strong>1.0 for accuracy, 0.2 for language consistency of reasoning traces, and 0.2 for answer format</strong> <d-cite key="rastogi2025magistral"></d-cite>.</p> <p>📊 <strong>Evaluation.</strong></p> <p>We tried our approach on three different languages: <strong>Japanese (JA) / French (FR) / Spanish (ES)</strong></p> <p>And tested on multiple datasets: <strong>MMLU College Math (MMLU Math), AIME25, GPQA, MMLU Pro Medicine (MMLU Med)</strong></p> <p>The first two are in-domain: MMLU-Math is similar to the training data in terms of hardness, while AIME25 is harder.<br/> The other two are out-of-domain: GPQA covers hard science questions, and MMLU Pro Medicine is made up of hard questions in the medical domain.</p> <p><strong>Regimes tested:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Base → <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</code> <d-cite key="deepseekai2025deepseekr1distillqwen7b"></d-cite></li> <li>SFT on top of Base</li> <li>GRPO-from-Base</li> <li>GRPO-from-SFT</li> </ul> <p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pass@k(1,5,10)</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n = 32</code> for accuracy</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Language-consistency %</code> (both reasoning traces <strong>and</strong> final answers must be in the requested language; script-aware checks)</li> </ul> <p><strong>How we score language consistency:</strong><br/> We check the entire CoT span and the final boxed answer.<br/> A sample counts as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Following = 1</code> only if both passages are in the requested language (script tokens, numerals, and markers allowed); otherwise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>.<br/> We report the % across the set.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="-key-contributions">🔑 Key contributions</h2> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Small SFT reprograms inner monologue.</strong><br/> With only <strong>817 chains</strong>, language consistency rises near the ceiling in French/Spanish across datasets and substantially in Japanese (Fig. RQ0).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Two-step recipe Pareto-improves.</strong><br/> SFT secures language consistency; <strong>GRPO-SFT recovers/boosts accuracy on tough sets</strong> (AIME/GPQA) without reverting to English (Figs.

Adding math-only GRPO then recovers or improves accuracy on hard sets like AIME and GPQA while mostly preserving SFT’s language consistency discipline — pushing the Accuracy × Following frontier in many language–dataset pairs. The two pain points, Japanese (tokenization/numeric friction) and medicine (reward/style mismatch), are expected from the base prior and training signal, and both have potential straightforward fixes with light domain augmentation. And surprisingly, model merging can be very useful and effective.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Figure 1.a) Performance comparison overall across methods</strong></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1a-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1a-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1a-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1a.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><strong>Figure 1.b) Overall language consistency rate comparison across methods</strong></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1b-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1b-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1b-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-budget-alignment/1b.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <hr/> <h2 id="rq0--can-small-sft-reprogram-a-reasoning-models-reasoning-tone">RQ0 — Can small SFT reprogram a reasoning model’s “reasoning tone”?</h2> <p>Models often output the final answer in the same language as the user query.

LLMs also reshape the way publishers (i.e., content creators) generate content: they increasingly use LLMs and agentic tools to optimize rankings in traditional search and to improve their content visibility in the novel chat-like systems. Importantly, publishers engage in an iterative process: they observe how their content performs — whether it is highly ranked in the traditional search or visible in chat-like answers — and then strategically modify or regenerate their content in response to this feedback. As a result, the ecosystem becomes a strategic game with incomplete information, evolving feedback, and repeated interactions. In this strategic ecosystem, the publishers act as players striving to promote their content, competing for rankings and visibility under mechanisms that are only partially known to them. This blog outlines why game theory offers a natural framework to model these settings and to design agents acting on behalf of publishers. We highlight several frameworks such as Game theory and Multi-agent Reinforcement learning and show how they contribute to model and design effective agents. Our aim is to provide principled lens for content promotion in the LLM era.</p> <h2 id="llms-reshape-both-sides-of-the-search-ecosystem">LLMs Reshape Both Sides of the Search Ecosystem</h2> <p>Large language models have fundamentally reshaped the search experience <d-cite key="metzler_rethinking_2021"></d-cite>. While users once typed short keyword queries and scanned a ranked list of links, modern systems now offer chat-like interfaces that feel more like interacting with an assistant than browsing a directory. These systems provide conversational question-answering (QA) capabilities by generating responses synthesized from multiple sources. Search is no longer about “links” — it is about responses. In the service of providing answers to questions, paradigms such as Retrieval Augmented Generate (RAG) <d-cite key="gao_retrieval_augmented_2024"></d-cite> have been developed. Similar paradigms were suggested for integrate commercial content in the answer <d-cite key="feizi_online_2024, mordo_sponsored_2024"></d-cite>. The new chat-like setting introduces new challenges, such as providing users with pointers to sources of information, leading to techniques known as source attribution <d-cite key="bohnet_attributed_2023"></d-cite>. Interestingly, effective retrieval has become a necessity in this new setting: augmenting an LLM with the ability to retrieve relevant information during answer generation or to retrieve the most relevant source to attribute to related pieces of information.</p> <p>But the transformation is not limited to the user side of the ecosystem.</p> <p>LLMs are also reshaping the publisher side. In the traditional Web era, publishers focused on keyword and hyperlink optimization, and content structure to influence ranking <d-cite key="gyongyi_web_2005"></d-cite>. Today, publishers increasingly rely on LLMs:</p> <ul> <li>to generate or refine content;</li> <li>to adapt their content to the behavior of LLM-driven retrieval and QA systems;</li> <li>to strategically shape their content so that they are selected, quoted, or incorporated into the ranked list of results or the generated answer.</li> </ul> <p>The paradigm of helping publishers in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses is often called Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) <d-cite key="aggarwal_geo_2024"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="publisher-incentives-across-coexisting-ecosystems">Publisher Incentives Across Coexisting Ecosystems</h2> <p>The search ecosystem is not transitioning overnight — it is evolving. Today, publishers operate in a hybrid world where traditional search engines and LLM-driven chat interfaces coexist. Users still issue keyword queries and click ranked results, yet they also increasingly engage with conversational systems that generate responses. As a result, publishers must navigate two overlapping incentive structures at once.</p> <h3 id="publishers-incentives-in-the-traditional-setting">Publishers’ Incentives in the Traditional Setting</h3> <p>In the traditional setting, publisher goals are well-defined and widely understood. Visibility depends on ranking, which in turn hinges on factors, some of which are familiar:</p> <ul> <li>content relevance;</li> <li>content quality and structure;</li> <li>signals (e.g., PageRank <d-cite key="page_pagerank_1999"></d-cite>).</li> </ul> <p>Metrics such as impressions and CTR (Click Through Rate) offer interpretable objectives.</p> <h3 id="publishers-incentives-in-the-chat-like-settings">Publishers’ Incentives in the Chat-Like Settings</h3> <p>By contrast, the objectives in the chat-like settings are far less defined. Publishers know that visibility is tied to whether the chat-like setting:</p> <ul> <li>retrieves their content;</li> <li>cites or incorporates it into the generated response;</li> <li>and positions it prominently in the generated response.</li> </ul> <p>But unlike in traditional search, where there is a clear notion of a ranked results page, LLM-based systems provide no public ranking, and often little transparency about how sources are selected for retrieval or attribution.</p> <p>The publisher’s utility is therefore inherently vague: Is success defined by:</p> <ul> <li>citation count?</li> <li>contribution to the generated answer?</li> <li>similarity of the generated answer to the publisher’s content?</li> <li>some combination of the above?</li> </ul> <p>The field has not yet converged on a clear success criterion, and the objective itself is still ill-defined, making strategic optimization an open problem.</p> <h2 id="leveraging-llms-for-content-optimization">Leveraging LLMs for Content Optimization</h2> <p>Publishers — or agents acting on behalf of them — can leverage LLMs as powerful content optimization tools (See Figures <a href="#fig1">1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a>). The publishers are incentivized to have effective automatic generation to promote their content. However, any such agentic systems should be carefully designed:</p> <ul> <li>address the tradeoff between “content promotion” (e.g., being selected in the search results or being visible in the generated response) and “faithfulness” to the original intent (e.g., not deviating from the content before optimization);</li> <li>address the uncertainty about the ranker or the content selection/generation mechanism;</li> <li>address competing agents which aim to optimize contents of other stakeholders.</li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-12" id="fig1"> <figure> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-content-promotion-agent-design/banana-search.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Content optimization in a traditional search setting"/> <figcaption class="caption" style="color: inherit;"> <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Content optimization in a traditional search setting. </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-12" id="fig2"> <figure> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-content-promotion-agent-design/banana-chat-fixed-with-gpt.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Content optimization in a chat-like setting"/> <figcaption class="caption" style="color: inherit;"> <strong>Figure 2:</strong> Content optimization in a chat-like setting. </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="content-promotion-as-a-game">Content Promotion as a Game</h2> <p>We argue that game theory provides a major and essential framework for analyzing the resulting competitive dynamics and for designing agents that assist publishers to strategically promote their content. More precisely, repeated games with incomplete information <d-cite key="aumann_repeated_1995"></d-cite>, induced by the system (search or chat-like system). Actions correspond to content generation (or modification). Strategies are history dependent content selection/generation algorithms and strategy profiles capture joint activity of agents which are active in the ecosystem. The utility function of an agent is the accumulated payoff along time, taking into account aspects such as ranking (for traditional search), visibility (for the chat-like systems) and faithfulness to the original content before any modification. As the selection/generation mechanism is only partially known, the setting is of incomplete information. Since the publisher may keep improving the content once she receives feedback from the system, we argue that the game should be treated as a repeated game. Figures <a href="#fig3">3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a> present schematic illustrations of the resulting games for search systems and chat-like systems, respectively.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" id="fig3"> <figure> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-content-promotion-agent-design/search-schema-nbg.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Schematic illustration of a traditional search game"/> <figcaption class="caption text-center" style="color: inherit;"> <strong>Figure 3:</strong> Schematic illustration of a traditional search game. </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" id="fig4"> <figure> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-content-promotion-agent-design/chat-schema-nbg.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Schematic illustration of a chat-like game"/> <figcaption class="caption text-center" style="color: inherit;"> <strong>Figure 4:</strong> Schematic illustration of a chat-like game. </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The viewpoint just presented is aligned with a growing body of research that treats content promotion as a strategic process. During recent years, several works have applied game-theoretic approaches to model competitive search <d-cite key="kurland_competitive_2022"></d-cite>, diversity-based ranking <d-cite key="mordo_ameliorating_2025"></d-cite>, to study the convergence of long term behavior to equilibrium in retrieval settings <d-cite key="madmon_search_2024, madmon_convergence_2024"></d-cite> and to design equilibrium in ranking games using corpus enrichment <d-cite key="nachimovsky_power_2025"></d-cite>. <d-cite key="ye_llm_empowered_2025"></d-cite> explored strategic document modifications in response to ranking feedback, revealing rich and sometimes counterintuitive dynamics. Yao et al.’s work provides deep, game-theoretic insight into how creators behave strategically in recommender systems and offers actionable designs for systems to align creator incentives with user welfare <d-cite key="yao_how_2023, yao_user_2024, yao_human_2024"></d-cite>. In the context of strategic retrieval systems, <d-cite key="mordo_sponsored_2024"></d-cite> presented the first formal game-theoretic analysis of a sponsored QA system where advertisers bid to have their sponsored content fused in the generated answer of question-answering systems. <d-cite key="mordo_sponsored_2024"></d-cite> showed how this new ad-integration model introduces strategic bidding behavior and derived equilibrium properties and welfare implications in this setting.</p> <p>However, the technological transformation of the last few years — particularly the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces — calls for re-examination and adaptation of the assumptions in classical game theoretic models. Traditional work often assumes fixed ranking functions and explicit publishers’ incentives. In contrast, chat-like systems generate personalized and dynamic answers <d-cite key="metzler_rethinking_2021"></d-cite>; the objective of publishers becomes much harder to define. These shifts motivate the development of new models that account for generative selection mechanisms, opaque feedback, and high adaptivity — all of which strengthen the case for game-theoretic reasoning and for new solution concepts.</p> <h2 id="agent-design-aspects-for-traditional-search-and-chat-like-systems">Agent Design Aspects for Traditional Search and Chat-like Systems</h2> <p>We delve into three important aspects that should be considered when designing agents that assist publishers promote their content.</p> <p>The first ingredient that can (and will) be naturally used, is to exploit the significant power of LLMs, e.g., use clever prompt engineering to promote content and maintain faithfulness in such games.</p> <p>A second ingredient one should be aware of is incomplete information about the selection or generation mechanism applied by the system. Using, for example, information about the decision made by the mechanism (e.g., past responses) can help to train and fine tune agents.</p> <p>The third ingredient is the need to be aware of competitors’ behavior. With limited access to annotated data — and only partial observability of the decisions made by these systems — this calls for carefully designed simulation tools. here again LLMs can be used as effective generative tools.</p> <p>Heretofore, we have described content promotion as a publishers game, shaped by evolving search and chat-based ecosystems and by the increasing role of generative AI. We now discuss different frameworks that can be employed to model and design effective agents in such settings.</p> <h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2> <h3 id="multi-agent-reinforcement-learning-marl">Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)</h3> <p>This framework models each player as an autonomous learning agent that optimizes its policy through repeated interaction with the environment and with other agents. MARL enables us to study how strategic behaviors emerge end-to-end from experience, without imposing strong assumptions about how these systems (i.e., search or chat-like systems) operate internally <d-cite key="gemp_developing_2022, guo_large_2024, shoham_if_2025, zhou_multi_agent_2025"></d-cite>. It also allows us to analyze coordination, competition, and non- stationarity — core properties of competitive games under a principled RL formulation. In our setting, the policy of the agent is the LLM itself, and reinforcement learning is the mechanism that aligns this LLM to the objectives of the game, given whatever information the agent can observe; different RL alignment algorithms may be adopted; e.g., <d-cite key="schulman_proximal_2017, rafailov_direct_2024, calandriello_multi-turn_2024, zhou_wpo_2024, shao_deepseekmath_2024"></d-cite>. If we had access to a full log of games — for example, historical queries and the ranking of pages in traditional search, or user questions and the resulting responses in chat-like systems — then we could directly formulate a supervised or RL-based learning problem. With such logs, the agent could be trained to optimize performance with respect to well-defined metrics (e.g., rank position, click-through, user engagement, rejection rates, etc.). Beyond the standard trade-offs encountered in reinforcement learning, our settings introduce unique design tensions that must be addressed:</p> <h4 id="a-short-term-wins-vs-long-term-information-leakage">(a) Short-term wins vs. long-term information leakage</h4> <p>An agent may be able to win an individual round of a game by aggressively optimizing its content. However, doing so may reveal its strategy to competing agents, enabling them to quickly imitate <d-cite key="raifer_information_2017"></d-cite> or counter it. Since the objective is to maximize cumulative reward across many rounds, the agent must balance immediate gains with strategic opacity — sometimes deliberately avoiding overly distinctive or extreme actions to prevent being copied <d-cite key="aumann_repeated_1995"></d-cite>.</p> <h4 id="b-on-policy-vs-off-policy-training">(b) On-policy vs. off-policy training</h4> <p>A crucial design question is whether the agent should continue learning during the game (on-policy) or rely solely on offline training before the game begins (off-policy).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Online adaptation</strong> allows the agent to track shifting competitor behaviors or evolving ranking/generation mechanisms.</li> <li><strong>Offline training</strong> offers stability and avoids overfitting to short-term noise or adversarial manipulations. Choosing between online and offline modes — or combining them — depends on the environment’s stability, observability, and the computational budget during gameplay.</li> </ul> <h4 id="c-constructing-the-loss-function">(c) Constructing the loss function</h4> <p>A core challenge is designing a loss function that balances ranking promotion or content visibility with faithfulness to the original content. On one hand, the agent should modify content to improve performance; on the other hand, excessive deviation risks harming credibility, violating constraints, or triggering penalties. The loss function must encode this balance explicitly — penalizing harmful drift while incentivizing strategic, beneficial content modifications.</p> <h3 id="synthetic-dataset-generation">Synthetic Dataset Generation</h3> <p>Sometimes real-world data presents substantial limitations: it may be inaccessible, noisy, incomplete, or simply ill-suited for the specific questions we wish to study. For this reason, we propose constructing synthetic datasets with controlled statistical properties. Synthetic data enables us to systematically probe targeted hypotheses — for example, how diversity constraints, noise structure, or shifts in the query or question distribution influence agent behavior and system-level outcomes. Moreover, synthetic datasets provide repeatability and experimental control that are often impossible with logs of production systems. They allow for clean ablation studies, controlled perturbations, and the isolation of causal factors, all of which are essential for understanding and improving agents operating in competitive ranking and chat-like ecosystems. Importantly LLMs now make it feasible to generate high-fidelity synthetic datasets at scale, enabling richer and more flexible experimental environments than were previously possible.</p> <h3 id="simulation-environment">Simulation Environment</h3> <p>A simulation environment that models the rules of the game, the ranking or generation function, and the interaction protocol between agents is essential in the discussed strategic ecosystems <d-cite key="kovarik_game_2024"></d-cite>. Such simulation can be used for generating strategic synthetic training datasets and for evaluating agents under diverse conditions. Together with the increasing proliferation over the Web of generated AI content <d-cite key="spennemann_delving_2025"></d-cite>, we suggest using simulators of the discussed competitions. Such simulators support rapid iteration and controlled experimentation across a wide range of configurations — rankers, prompts, datasets, reward structures, and hyperparameters. By isolating specific components of the system, the simulation environment helps uncover causal relationships, identify sensitivities to design choices, and systematically analyze how agents behave under different competitive scenarios.</p> <h3 id="self-play">Self-Play</h3> <p>Self-play is a method for iteratively training agents to be improved by competing (via simulation) against evolving versions of themselves <d-cite key="fang_serl_2025, fu_improving_2023, zhang_survey_2025"></d-cite>. This approach is particularly useful in settings where optimal strategies are not known a priori and where the competitive landscape shifts over time. Self-play helps uncover equilibrium behaviors, stability properties, and potential failure modes of learning algorithms in adversarial or co-adaptive settings.</p> <h3 id="meta-games-and-learning-equilibrium">Meta Games and Learning Equilibrium</h3> <p>Agent design itself introduces an additional strategic layer: designers may choose between different LLM architectures, training procedures, datasets, prompting strategies, or RL frameworks. In this broader perspective, agents are not only competing within a single ranking or generation game, but the designers are competing in a meta-game over agent designs <d-cite key="li_meta_game_2024, nachimovsky_multi_agent_2025, shapira_glee_2025"></d-cite>. Long-run success therefore depends on performing well not only within the fixed game, but also across the distribution of possible design choices made by other participants. In such meta-games, no single deterministic design may be universally optimal.</p> <p>Instead, probabilistic ensembles of designs — mixtures over algorithms, prompting strategies, or training regimes — may provide better robustness and theoretical guarantees. These ensemble-based strategies reduce exploitability, adapt better to heterogeneous opponents, and align with classical results in game theory showing that mixed strategies often outperform pure ones in competitive environments.</p> <p>Within meta-games over agent designs, a natural solution concept is learning equilibrium <d-cite key="monderer_learning_2007"></d-cite>. Rather than focusing on equilibria of the underlying content-generation game — where actions correspond to the content produced — learning equilibrium concerns the design algorithms themselves being in equilibrium. That is, each designer’s strategy for constructing agents is optimal given the strategies of other designers, forming a stable configuration at the meta-level.</p> <p>This distinction is subtle but important: learning equilibrium ensures that agent designs collectively converge to a stable distribution, even as the content-generation game continues to evolve. Such a concept becomes particularly relevant in scenarios where a platform or cloud provider offers content-generation services to multiple competing parties. In this setting, providing agent designs that satisfy learning equilibrium naturally mitigates exploitability, promotes fairness, and guarantees robust performance across heterogeneous competitors.</p> <h2 id="preliminary-results">Preliminary Results</h2> <p>We now turn to discuss several papers that illustrate components (or the absence thereof) of the frameworks discussed above.</p> <h3 id="prompt-based-agent">Prompt-based Agent</h3> <p> <d-cite key="bardas_automatic_2025"></d-cite> introduced a set of prompt-based agents designed to modify a human-authored document so that the updated version is ranked higher in the next round of the ranking. Their prompting strategy explicitly constrains the agent to produce revisions that remain faithful — at least to some extent — to the original document. <d-cite key="bardas_automatic_2025"></d-cite> introduced prompt- engineering techniques that, in an offline evaluation, outperformed human-authored documents without requiring any learning. Their evaluation was conducted using data from a ranking competition previously organized among human document authors.</p> <h3 id="rlrf-based-agent">RLRF-based Agent</h3> <p> <d-cite key="mordo_rlrf_2025"></d-cite> proposed a ranker-aligned agent, trained via a reinforcement- learning-from-ranker-feedback (RLRF) framework. They constructed a synthetic dataset generated through a simulated ranking competition and used it to train the agent with the DPO algorithm <d-cite key="rafailov_direct_2024"></d-cite>. Notably, the resulting agent learned to adapt both to the ranking mechanism and to the behavior of competing agents. Their simulation-based evaluation demonstrates robustness with respect to various environmental conditions, including the number of competitors and the choice of ranking function. The simulation assumed that the competing agents are nonoptimized agents; this setup can be viewed as a variant of self-play, where agents iteratively interact under stable, nonlearning strategies.</p> <h3 id="lemss">LEMSS</h3> <p> <d-cite key="mordo_lemss_2025" block=""></d-cite> also introduced LEMSS, a large-scale simulation framework for ranking competitions among LLM-based agents. Their results show that LLM-driven agents exhibit behavioral patterns like those of humans in iterative ranking games. LEMSS provides fine-grained control over nearly all aspects of the competition — such as the number of competitors, the ranking mechanism, and the reward structure — and enables comprehensive analysis of the induced repeated game. The simulation models a traditional ranking competition. To design agents capable of promoting content in a chat-like interaction setting, a simulation of such a mechanism is called for.</p> <h3 id="attacking-rag-based-systems">Attacking RAG-based systems</h3> <p>Recent work highlights the growing vulnerability of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to targeted manipulation. PoisonedRAG <d-cite key="zou_poisonedrag_2024"></d-cite> shows that inserting only a few malicious documents into a RAG system’s knowledge base can steer model outputs with high success, revealing a potent “knowledge-corruption” attack surface. In contrast, RIPRAG <d-cite key="xi_riprag_2025"></d-cite> use reinforcement learning to craft effective poisoned documents without access to the system’s internals. <d-cite key="wu_what_2025"></d-cite> suggests to cooperatively optimize content for generative search engines by learning their preference rules. However, all these papers overlook the competitive nature of real-world environments, where multiple strategic content creators adaptively improve their content — potentially using agents — in a repeated game. This missing game-theoretic perspective limits their ability to capture the dynamics and equilibria that emerge when many actors simultaneously attempt to influence RAG- based systems.</p> <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2> <p>Designing agents for ranking and content promotion competition benefits from a growing ecosystem of LLM-oriented development tools. Copilot Studio, Vertex AI, and LangChain provide the infrastructure needed to orchestrate complex LLM workflows, connect models to external data, and manage iterative agent-environment interactions. Copilot Studio enables rapid prototyping of agent behaviors within controlled interfaces, while Vertex AI offers scalable model hosting, fine-tuning, and evaluation pipelines suited for experimentation at scale. LangChain adds modular abstractions — such as memory, tools, retrieval, and multi- step reasoning — that make it easier to construct agents capable of interacting with dynamic environments. In addition, there are many python packages that may help to design and simulate RL-based agents such as <d-cite key="feng_agile_2024, liu_agentlite_2024"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In this blog post, we discussed how LLMs are reshaping the search ecosystem — both in traditional search and in emerging chat-like question-answering systems. Beyond transforming how users search, LLMs also change how publishers operate, enabling them to leverage LLMs to strategically optimize and promote iteratively their content.</p> <p>We discussed several frameworks for modelling and designing such agents, including game- theoretic models and reinforcement learning approaches. These frameworks help account for multiple layers of uncertainty: the opaque ranking model or response-generation mechanisms of retrieval systems, the dynamic nature of evolving user queries/questions, and the competitive behavior of other strategic publishers or human content creators.</p> <p>To build robust and adaptable agents, we emphasized that simulation plays a crucial role. Simulations enable the creation of strategic synthetic datasets and provide controlled environments for evaluating agent behavior, stress-testing policy robustness, and studying long-term dynamics in repeated competitive scenarios.</p> <p>Overall, as the ecosystem continues to evolve, combining insights from game theory, reinforcement learning, and simulation offers a principled path toward designing agents capable of succeeding in both current and future search paradigms.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the rise of LLMs, publishers now operate in a dual world where traditional search and chat-like systems coexist.

Let \(\mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{conv}}_{G}\) be the class of <strong>translation-equivariant, finite-support Toeplitz operators</strong> (U-Net convolutional kernels) and \(\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{attn}}\) the class of <strong>self-attention kernels with relative positional structure</strong> (DiTs). Write \(\sqsubseteq^{\mathrm{bias}}\) as “is a constrained instance of (via inductive-bias constraints)”<d-cite key="hornTranslationalEquivarianceKernelizable2021"></d-cite><d-cite key="taiMathematicalExplanationUNet2024"></d-cite>.</p> \[\boxed{ \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{conv}}_{G}\ \sqsubseteq^{\mathrm{bias}}\ \mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{attn}} }\] <p>In plain terms, <strong>convolution is a simplified, efficient expression of attention</strong> obtained by enforcing fixed translation symmetry, parameter tying, and locality<d-cite key="ramachandranStandAloneSelfAttentionVision2019"></d-cite><d-cite key="cordonnierRelationshipSelfAttentionConvolutional2020"></d-cite><d-cite key="changConvolutionsSelfAttentionReinterpreting2021"></d-cite><d-cite key="choiGraphConvolutionsEnrich2024"></d-cite><d-cite key="joshiTransformersAreGraph2025"></d-cite>; removing these constraints yields attention <strong>without a hard-coded translation prior</strong>, allowing DiTs to <em>learn</em> which symmetries and long-range relations matter at scale. This inclusion explains the empirical shift under modern hardware and datasets: attention strictly generalizes convolution while retaining it as an efficient special case, delivering smoother scaling laws and higher semantic “bandwidth” per denoising step. In practice, this is also a story of hardware path dependence: attention’s dense-matrix primitives align with contemporary accelerators and compiler stacks, effectively “winning” the hardware lottery <d-cite key="hookerHardwareLottery2021"></d-cite>. And, echoing the Bitter Lesson<d-cite key="richsuttonBitterLesson2019"></d-cite>, as data and compute grow, general methods with fewer hand-engineered priors dominate—making attention’s strict generalization of convolution the natural backbone at scale.</p> <h2 id="further-discussion">Further Discussion</h2> <h3 id="from-text-to-image-generation-to-real-world-applications">From Text-to-Image Generation to Real-World Applications</h3> <p>Text-to-image is now genuinely strong; the next wave is about <strong>conditioning existing pixels</strong> rather than generating from scratch—turning models into reliable editors that honor what must stay and change only what’s asked. This means prioritizing downstream tasks like image editing, inpainting/outpainting, image-to-image restyling, and structure- or reference-guided synthesis (edges, depth, layout, style, identity). The practical focus shifts from unconstrained novelty to controllable, faithful rewrites with tight mask adherence, robust subject/style preservation, and interactive latencies, so these systems plug cleanly into real creative, design, and industrial workflows.</p> <h3 id="diffusion-models-vs-auto-regressive-models">Diffusion Models vs. Auto-regressive Models</h3> <p>Diffusion models and autoregressive (AR) models represent two fundamentally different approaches to image generation, with the key distinction being that <strong>autoregressive models operate on discrete image tokens</strong> while <strong>diffusion models work with continuous representations</strong>. Autoregressive models like DALL-E <d-cite key="rameshZeroShotTexttoImageGeneration2021"></d-cite>, CogView <d-cite key="dingCogViewMasteringTexttoImage2021"></d-cite>, and CogView2 <d-cite key="dingCogView2FasterBetter2022"></d-cite> treat image generation as a sequence modeling problem, encoding images into discrete tokens using VQ-VAE <d-cite key="esserTamingTransformersHighResolution2021"></d-cite> or similar vector quantization methods, then autoregressively predicting the next token given previous tokens. This approach offers sequential generation with precise control and natural language integration, but suffers from slow generation, error accumulation, and discrete representation loss. In contrast, diffusion models operate directly on continuous pixel or latent representations, learning to reverse a gradual noise corruption process, which enables parallel generation, high-quality outputs, and flexible conditioning, though at the cost of computational overhead and less direct control. Recent advances have significantly improved autoregressive approaches: VAR <d-cite key="tianVisualAutoregressiveModeling2024"></d-cite> redefines autoregressive learning as coarse-to-fine “next-scale prediction” and achieves superior performance compared to diffusion transformers, while Infinity <d-cite key="hanInfinityScalingBitwise2025"></d-cite> demonstrates effective scaling of bitwise autoregressive modeling for high-resolution synthesis. Additionally, MAR <d-cite key="liAutoregressiveImageGeneration2024a"></d-cite> bridges the gap between paradigms by adopting diffusion loss for autoregressive models, enabling continuous-valued autoregressive generation without vector quantization. Recent work has also explored hybrid approaches that combine both paradigms: HunyuanImage 3.0 <d-cite key="caoHunyuanImage30Technical2025"></d-cite> and BLIP3-o <d-cite key="chenBLIP3oFamilyFully2025"></d-cite> demonstrate unified multimodal models within autoregressive frameworks while incorporating diffusion-inspired techniques, while OmniGen <d-cite key="xiaoOmniGenUnifiedImage2024"></d-cite> and OmniGen2 <d-cite key="wuOmniGen2ExplorationAdvanced2025"></d-cite> use diffusion models as backbones for unified generation capabilities.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog post’s knowledge cutoff is November 17, 2025.

The fundamental difficulty is that many such problems are <strong>ill-posed</strong>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Non-uniqueness:</strong> if \(\mathbf{A}\) is rank-deficient or severely underdetermined, many different \(\mathbf{x}\) produce the same \(\mathbf{y}\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Instability:</strong> when \(\mathbf{A}\) is ill-conditioned, small perturbations in \(\mathbf{y}\) can cause large changes in the reconstructed \(\mathbf{x}\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>If we ignore prior knowledge and rely solely on the measurements to solve via maximum likelihood estimation</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MLE}} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{x}} \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2,\] <p>it yields the solution either does not exist, is not unique, or is extremely sensitive to noise. This motivates <strong>regularization</strong>: we bias the solution toward signals that are “plausible” under our prior knowledge. In probabilistic form, this leads to <strong>Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)</strong> estimation</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{x}} \left[ \underbrace{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2}_{\text{Data Consistency}} \quad + \underbrace{\lambda R(\mathbf{x})}_{\text{Prior / Regularization}} \right],\] <p>where \(R(\mathbf{x})\) is a regularizer encoding the prior, and \(\lambda &gt; 0\) controls the trade-off between data fidelity and prior strength.</p> <p>From this perspective, the history of solving inverse problems is essentially the history of designing better functions for $R(\mathbf{x})$ — from handcrafted mathematical assumptions to data-driven generative manifolds.</p> <h3 id="11-handcrafted-analytical-priors">1.1. Handcrafted Analytical Priors</h3> <p>Before the era of deep learning, priors were designed based on mathematical and statistical intuition about natural signals.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Smoothness priors (Tikhonov / Gaussian):</strong><br/> Assuming that \(\mathbf{x}\) varies smoothly, one uses \(R(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{L}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2\) for some differential or finite-difference operator \(\mathbf{L}\). This corresponds to a Gaussian prior and leads to classical Tikhonov regularization <d-cite key="tikhonov1977solutions"></d-cite>. Such priors are stable and convex, but they oversmooth edges and cannot hallucinate missing high-frequency details.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Total Variation (TV) and piecewise-smooth priors:</strong><br/> To better preserve edges, TV replaces the quadratic penalty with an \(\ell_1\)-type penalty on gradients, e.g., \(R(\mathbf{x}) = \|\nabla \mathbf{x}\|_1.\) TV assumes that images are mostly smooth with sparse sharp transitions, which works well for piecewise-constant structures but can introduce “staircase” artifacts and still struggles with fine textures.<d-cite key="rudin1992nonlinear"></d-cite></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sparsity priors (wavelets, dictionary learning):</strong><br/> Another line of work assumes that \(\mathbf{x}\) is sparse in a suitable transform domain, such as wavelets or learned dictionaries, leading to penalties like \(R(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x}\|_1,\) where \(\mathbf{W}\) is a fixed or learned transform. These priors capture certain classes of textures and edges, but still act as <strong>handcrafted surrogates</strong> for the true (and highly complex) distribution of natural signals.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All of these classical priors are <strong>analytical</strong>: they are given by explicit formulas chosen by the designer. They are computationally convenient and theoretically well understood, but ultimately limited in expressiveness. They can discourage obviously “bad” solutions, yet they do not truly know what realistic images look like.</p> <h3 id="12-explicit-generative-manifolds">1.2. Explicit Generative Manifolds</h3> <p>With the rise of deep generative models, we no longer had to <strong>guess</strong> analytical forms for \(R(\mathbf{x})\). Instead, we could <strong>learn</strong> the data distribution directly from examples, and then use that model as a prior.</p> <p>A common idea is the <strong>manifold constraint</strong>: assume that plausible signals lie near the range of a generator \(G(\mathbf{z})\), where \(\mathbf{z}\) is a low-dimensional latent code. Rather than optimizing directly over \(\mathbf{x}\), we optimize over \(\mathbf{z}\):</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{z}} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{z}} \left[ \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A}(G(\mathbf{z}))\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\mathbf{z}\|_2^2 \right], \qquad \hat{\mathbf{x}} = G(\hat{\mathbf{z}}).\] <p>Different generative models instantiate this idea in different ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>GANs <d-cite key="goodfellow2014generative"></d-cite>:</strong> Adversarial training yields highly realistic samples and sharp details. However, mode collapse and training instability make the learned manifold incomplete: if the ground-truth \(\mathbf{x}\) is not well covered by the generator, optimization in \(\mathbf{z}\) may fail or converge to a visually plausible but incorrect solution.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>VAEs <d-cite key="kingma2013auto"></d-cite>:</strong> VAEs provide a probabilistic decoder \(p_\theta(\mathbf{x}\mid \mathbf{z})\) with a simple prior on \(\mathbf{z}\) (often Gaussian). Their reconstructions are typically smoother and more stable than GANs but tend to be <strong>blurry</strong>, reflecting the ELBO objective’s tendency to average over modes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normalizing Flows <d-cite key="dinh2016density,kingma2018glow"></d-cite> and related models:</strong> Flows provide exact likelihoods and invertible mappings, so in principle they offer a very clean way to define \(p(\mathbf{x})\). In practice, however, they impose architectural constraints (e.g., invertibility and tractable Jacobians), and solving inverse problems with them often requires expensive Jacobian–vector products or MCMC steps.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In all these cases, the prior is no longer an explicit penalty \(R(\mathbf{x})\) but an <strong>implicit manifold</strong> traced out by a neural generator. This brings much richer structure but also introduces new optimization and modeling challenges: enforcing measurement consistency while staying on (or near) the learned manifold is nontrivial.</p> <h3 id="13-the-shift-to-diffusion-prior">1.3. The Shift to Diffusion Prior</h3> <p>Both previous families of priors have clear trade-offs:</p> <ul> <li>Classical analytical priors are <strong>stable, convex, and easy to optimize</strong>, but they are too simple to faithfully model complex natural images.</li> <li>Explicit generative manifolds are <strong>expressive</strong> and can synthesize highly realistic samples, but they are often <strong>hard to optimize against</strong> and can be brittle outside the training distribution.</li> </ul> <p>Diffusion models <d-cite key="ho2020denoising,song2020score"></d-cite> offer a different compromise. Instead of defining a single deterministic manifold or a closed-form regularizer, they define a <strong>stochastic generative process</strong> that gradually transforms simple noise into data through a sequence of Gaussian denoising steps. Conceptually, they give us:</p> <ul> <li>A powerful, flexible <strong>prior over signals</strong>, encoded by a learned score or denoiser.</li> <li>A natural way to <strong>interleave prior-driven denoising with measurement-driven corrections</strong> along the sampling trajectory.</li> </ul> <p>This “dynamic” view of the prior—where we guide a stochastic or deterministic trajectory through noisy space—makes diffusion models particularly attractive for inverse problems. It allows us to inject measurement information <strong>gradually</strong>, to decouple a pretrained diffusion prior from the forward operator \(\mathbf{A}\), and to design algorithms that behave more like <strong>operator-splitting schemes</strong> than hard manifold projection. The rest of this post develops this perspective in detail.</p> <h2 id="2-diffusion-priors-for-inverse-problems">2. Diffusion priors for inverse problems</h2> <p>In the background section we framed inverse problems as Bayesian inference with a prior over clean signals \(\mathbf{x}_0\) and a likelihood induced by the forward operator \(\mathbf{A}\). With a diffusion model, this prior is no longer given by an explicit energy \(R(\mathbf{x}_0)\) or a simple manifold parameterization \(G(\mathbf{z})\). Instead, it is encoded in a <strong>stochastic generative process</strong> that gradually transforms Gaussian noise into data. This section explains how that process works and why it makes inverse problems both powerful and subtle.</p> <h3 id="21-bayesian-gold-standard-with-a-diffusion-prior">2.1. Bayesian “gold standard” with a diffusion prior</h3> <p>Consider again the inverse problem where the measurement is generated from a forward model \(\mathbf{y} \sim p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0),\) with \(\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p(\mathbf{x}_0)\) given by a diffusion prior. In the simplest case we assume additive Gaussian noise (Eq. \eqref{eq:ip}), so that</p> \[p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0) \propto \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0\|_2^2\Big).\] <p>By Bayes’ rule, the posterior over clean signals is</p> \[p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{y}) \;\propto\; p(\mathbf{y}\mid\mathbf{x}_0)\,p(\mathbf{x}_0).\] <p>If we could evaluate \(\log p(\mathbf{x}_0)\) and its gradient exactly, the <strong>Bayesian gold standard</strong> would be the MAP estimator</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\max_{\mathbf{x}_0} \left[ \underbrace{\log p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0)}_{\text{Data fidelity}} + \underbrace{\log p(\mathbf{x}_0)}_{\text{Prior}} \right]. \tag{2.1}\label{eq:obj}\] <p>Conceptually this is straightforward: we simply trade off how well \(\mathbf{x}_0\) explains the measurement \(\mathbf{y}\) versus how plausible \(\mathbf{x}_0\) is under the diffusion prior. In practice, diffusion models make this optimization non-trivial, because the prior is not defined directly in the clean space \(\mathbf{x}_0\).</p> <h3 id="22-diffusion-models-live-in-noisy-space">2.2. Diffusion models live in noisy space</h3> <p>A modern diffusion model is trained in a <strong>noisy</strong> space. One common continuous-time formulation uses a forward SDE</p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,dt + g(t)\,d\mathbf{w}_t, \qquad t\in[0,1],\] <p>where \(\mathbf{x}_0\) is a clean data sample, \(\mathbf{x}_1\) is approximately Gaussian noise, and \(\mathbf{w}_t\) is standard Brownian motion. The forward SDE defines a family of intermediate marginals \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) that smoothly interpolate between the data distribution at \(t=0\) and a simple reference (typically Gaussian) at \(t=1\). Training learns a <strong>score network</strong></p> \[s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t) \approx \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t),\] <p>i.e., a vector field that points in the direction of steeper log-density at each noise level. Geometrically, the score pushes samples uphill towards regions of higher probability. At generation time, we can run the <strong>reverse-time SDE</strong> <d-cite key="anderson1982reverse"></d-cite></p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = \Big[f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) - g^2(t)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\Big]\,dt + g(t)\,d\bar{\mathbf{w}}_t,\] <p>from \(t=1\) (pure noise) to \(t=0\) (clean data), where \(\bar{\mathbf{w}}_t\) is a standard Brownian motion in reversed time. Alternatively, Song et al. <d-cite key="song2020score"></d-cite> showed that there exists a deterministic <strong>probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE)</strong></p> \[\frac{d\mathbf{x}_t}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\,\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t),\] <p>whose solution curves share the same marginals \(\{p_t\}_{t\in[0,1]}\) as the stochastic SDE. Intuitively, the SDE adds randomness while the ODE simply transports probability mass along the same flow.</p> <p>Crucially, all of these objects – the forward SDE, the reverse SDE, and the PF-ODE – are defined in terms of the <strong>noisy</strong> variables \(\mathbf{x}_t\) and their densities \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\). The prior \(p(\mathbf{x}_0)\) only appears implicitly as the marginal at time zero of this process. This creates a mismatch for inverse problems:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The likelihood \(p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}_0)\) in Eq. \eqref{eq:obj} is naturally written in the <strong>clean space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_0\).</p> </li> <li> <p>The diffusion prior is only directly accessible through scores \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) in the <strong>noisy space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_t\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>The rest of this blogpost can be read as a sequence of techniques for bridging this gap: how to couple measurement information with a prior that lives along a diffusion trajectory.</p> <h3 id="23-tweedies-estimator-as-a-clean-space-anchor">2.3. Tweedie’s estimator as a clean-space anchor</h3> <p>A key tool for connecting noisy and clean spaces is <strong>Tweedie’s formula</strong>. In the simplest (and widely used) setting, the forward diffusion at time \(t\) can be written as</p> \[\mathbf{x}_t = \alpha(t)\,\mathbf{x}_0 + \sigma(t)\,\boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \qquad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}),\] <p>where \(\alpha(t)\) and \(\sigma(t)\) are scalar functions that control the signal and noise levels. Under this Gaussian corruption model, Tweedie’s formula tells us that the posterior mean of the clean signal given a noisy observation \(\mathbf{x}_t\) is</p> \[\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t) \;=\; \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}_0\mid\mathbf{x}_t] \;=\; \frac{\mathbf{x}_t + \sigma^2(t)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)}{\alpha(t)}.\] <p>Here \(s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t) \approx \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) is the score learned by the diffusion model. Thus, once the diffusion prior is trained, we can <em>decode</em> any noisy point \(\mathbf{x}_t\) into a corresponding <strong>clean-space estimate</strong> \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) using only the score network.</p> <p>From a statistical perspective, \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) is the <strong>minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)</strong> estimator of \(\mathbf{x}_0\) given \(\mathbf{x}_t\): among all possible functions of \(\mathbf{x}_t\), it minimizes the expected squared error</p> \[\mathbb{E}\big[\|\mathbf{x}_0 - \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\|_2^2\big].\] <p>It is therefore a principled, Bayes-optimal representative of the posterior distribution over \(\mathbf{x}_0\) for that particular noise level. From a geometric perspective, we can interpret \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) as a kind of <strong>clean-space anchor</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Let \(M_0\) denote the (unknown) data manifold where the diffusion prior assigns high density at \(t=0\).</li> <li>For a noisy point \(\mathbf{x}_t\), the posterior over \(\mathbf{x}_0\) given \(\mathbf{x}_t\) is typically concentrated near a small region on or near \(M_0\).</li> <li>Tweedie’s estimator \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) sits near the <em>center of mass</em> of that posterior cloud. It lives in a high-density neighborhood of \(M_0\), even if it is not exactly on the manifold, and becomes increasingly accurate as \(\sigma(t)\to 0\).</li> </ul> <p>We will repeatedly exploit this anchor in later sections:</p> <ul> <li> <p>In <strong>posterior-guided sampling</strong> (Section 3), we use Tweedie’s estimator to approximate <em>posterior</em> scores in noisy space, enabling us to modify the reverse SDE/ODE so that it samples from an approximation to \(p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid\mathbf{y})\).</p> </li> <li> <p>In <strong>clean-space Local-MAP optimization</strong> (Section 4), we treat \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\) as a good initialization in clean space and locally refine it to better satisfy the measurement constraints.</p> </li> </ul> <figure class="figure"> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-diffusion-inverse-problems/tweedie_anchor_sine.gif" alt="Posterior-guided sampling: prior vs naive guidance vs Jacobian guidance" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; image-rendering: auto;"/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Animation 1: Tweedie denoising as a clean-space anchor. </div> <p><strong>Animated illustration – posterior mean vs. data manifold.</strong><br/> Consider a simple 2D sine-shaped data manifold \(M_0\) and a single clean point \(\mathbf{x}_0\) on it.

Posterior-Guided Sampling Paradigm</h2> <p>In this section, we focus on <strong>posterior-guided sampling</strong>, a family of methods that solve inverse problems by directly sampling from the Bayesian posterior under a diffusion prior, exemplified by DPS <d-cite key="chung2022diffusion"></d-cite> and MCG methods <d-cite key="chung2022improving"></d-cite>. The key idea is extremely simple:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p>Take the reverse-time dynamics of the diffusion model, and replace the <strong>prior score</strong> \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) with the <strong>posterior score</strong> \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\).</p> </aside> <p>Concretely, recall the probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) associated with the forward SDE</p> \[\frac{d\mathbf{x}_t}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) -\frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\,s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t), \qquad s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\approx \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t),\] <p>whose solution at \(t=0\) recovers samples from the data distribution \(p_{\text{data}}\).

Why Inverse Problems Can Be Solved by Sampling</h3> <p>We first revisit why <strong>sampling</strong> from a suitable reverse-time process solves not only the unconditional generative problem, but also the <strong>inverse problem</strong>.</p> <p>We begin with the <strong>unconditional</strong> case. Let \(\{ \mathbf{x}_t \}_{t\in[0,T]}\) be a trajectory followed by the forward diffusion SDE,</p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,dt + g(t)\,d\mathbf{w}_t,\qquad \mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_{\text{data}},\] <p>with marginal densities \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\). These densities satisfy the <strong>Fokker–Planck equation</strong></p> \[\partial_t p_t(\mathbf{x}_t) = -\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\!\cdot\!\big(f(\mathbf{x}_t,t)\,p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\big) +\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}^2\!\big(g^2(t)\,p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\big).\] <p>Song et al. <d-cite key="song2020score,anderson1982reverse"></d-cite> showed that there exists both a <strong>reverse-time SDE</strong> and an equivalent <strong>PF-ODE</strong> whose marginals evolve backward in time but follow the <strong>same</strong> family of densities \(\{p_t\}\). In particular, the PF-ODE</p> \[\frac{d\mathbf{x}_t}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}_t,t) - \frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\,\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\] <p>satisfies the same Fokker–Planck equation as the forward SDE, but with time running from \(t=1\) back to \(t=0\).

The Jacobian as an approximate tangent-space projector</h3> <p>The key takeaway from Eq. \eqref{eq:lik} is that the Jacobian of the Tweedie denoiser does not act in an arbitrary way: under the standard “data lie near a smooth manifold” assumption and in the small-noise regime, it behaves <strong>approximately</strong> like a projection onto the tangent space of the data manifold. This is exactly what we want for inverse problems: the likelihood gradient should pull us <strong>along</strong> the manifold rather than pushing us off it.</p> <p>To make this precise, assume that clean data concentrate near a smooth $d_0$-dimensional manifold $M_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. For notational simplicity, work in local coordinates around some point $x^\star \in M_0$ and decompose any nearby point as</p> \[x_t = x^\star + u + n,\] <p>where $u \in T_{x^\star} M_0$ is the tangent component and $n \perp T_{x^\star} M_0$ is the normal component.</p> <p>In the small-noise regime with Gaussian corruption $x_t = x_0 + \sigma \varepsilon$, $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$, a standard manifold argument (see e.g. denoising-score literature) shows that the log-density of $x_t$ can be approximated as</p> \[\log p_t(x_t) \;\approx\; C(u) \;-\; \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\,\|n\|^2,\] <p>where $C(u)$ varies slowly along the manifold and the quadratic term penalizes distance in the normal direction. Consequently, the score is approximately</p> \[\nabla_{x_t} \log p_t(x_t) \;\approx\; -\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\,n,\] <p>i.e., it points back toward the manifold by cancelling the normal offset $n$. Plugging this into Tweedie’s formula,</p> \[\hat x_0(x_t,t) = x_t + \sigma^2 \nabla_{x_t} \log p_t(x_t),\] <p>we obtain, to first order,</p> \[\hat x_0(x_t,t) \;\approx\; x_t + \sigma^2\Big(-\frac{1}{\sigma^2} n\Big) = x_t - n = x^\star + u.\] <p>In other words, when the noise is small and the model is accurate, the Tweedie denoiser $\hat x_0(x_t,t)$ behaves like the <strong>nearest-point projection</strong> onto the data manifold:</p> \[\hat x_0(x_t,t) \;\approx\; \Pi(x_t) \;:=\; \arg\min_{z \in M_0} \|z - x_t\|_2^2.\] <p>For this nearest-point projection map $\Pi$, classical differential geometry tells us that its Jacobian at a point $x_t$ whose projection is $x^\star = \Pi(x_t)$ is the orthogonal projector onto the tangent space $T_{x^\star} M_0$:</p> \[D\Pi(x_t) = P_{T_{x^\star} M_0}.\] <p>Intuitively, a small perturbation $\delta x_t$ of the input decomposes into</p> \[\delta x_t = \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}} + \delta x_{\mathrm{nor}}, \quad \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}} \in T_{x^\star} M_0,\; \delta x_{\mathrm{nor}} \perp T_{x^\star} M_0.\] <p>Under the projection, the tangent component moves the projected point along the manifold, while the normal component is largely “forgotten”:</p> \[D\Pi(x_t)\,\delta x_t \;\approx\; \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}}.\] <p>Since Tweedie’s denoiser $\hat x_0(x_t,t)$ is, in the small-noise limit, a smooth perturbation of this nearest-point projection, its Jacobian $J_{\hat x_0}(x_t) = \partial \hat x_0 / \partial x_t$ inherits the same behavior:</p> \[J_{\hat x_0}(x_t)\,\delta x_t \;\approx\; \delta x_{\mathrm{tan}},\] <p>i.e., it <strong>keeps</strong> the tangent component and <strong>suppresses</strong> the normal component of any perturbation.</p> <p>Plugging this geometric picture back into Eq. \eqref{eq:lik}, we can reinterpret the likelihood score as</p> \[\nabla_{x_t}\log p(y \mid x_t) \;\approx\; \underbrace{J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)}_{\text{tangent-space projector}}\, \underbrace{\nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0)\big|_{x_0=\hat x_0(x_t,t)}}_{\text{clean-space DC gradient}}.\] <p>Geometrically:</p> <ol> <li> <p>We first compute a <strong>clean-space data-consistency gradient</strong></p> \[g_{x_0} = \nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} A^\top (y - A \hat x_0),\] <p>which tells us how to move $\hat x_0$ to better match the measurement.</p> </li> <li> <p>We then apply $J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)$, which approximately projects this gradient onto the tangent space $T_{\hat x_0} M_0$, removing its normal component.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The resulting likelihood score in noisy space moves $x_t$ in a direction that (i) improves data consistency because it originates from $g_{x_0}$, and (ii) remains compatible with the diffusion prior because its normal component has been suppressed. In this approximate sense, the Jacobian of Tweedie’s estimator acts as a <strong>tangent-space projector</strong> for likelihood guidance.</p> <h3 id="34-2d-toy-illustration">3.4. 2D Toy Illustration</h3> <p>To make the geometric effect of the Jacobian term more concrete, we visualize a toy 2D inverse problem where the clean data lie on a sine-shaped manifold \(M_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^2\). We fix a single target point \(x_0^\star \in M_0\) (red star) that is consistent with the measurement \(\mathbf{y}\), and start the reverse diffusion from a noisy point far away from the manifold. At each reverse-time step we consider three different update rules, corresponding to three panels in the animation.</p> <figure class="figure"> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-diffusion-inverse-problems/posterior_guided_sampling.gif" alt="Posterior-guided sampling: prior vs naive guidance vs Jacobian guidance" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; image-rendering: auto;"/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Animation 2: Clean-space local-MAP as a denoise–optimize–re-noise scheme. </div> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Prior-only dynamics (left).</strong> In the first panel we ignore the measurement and only follow the diffusion <strong>prior score</strong>. Geometrically, this score always pulls the current state \(x_t\) back towards the nearest point on the learned manifold \(M_0\). The trajectory (purple) quickly relaxes to some high-density region of the prior, but this point has no reason to satisfy the measurement. This corresponds to unconditional sampling: we solve the generative problem, not the inverse problem.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prior + naive guidance in noisy space (middle).</strong> In the second panel we add a <strong>naive likelihood guidance</strong> term directly in the ambient space, approximating the posterior score as</p> \[\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t \mid y) \;\approx\; s_\theta(x_t,t) \;+\; \underbrace{\nabla_{x_t} \log p(y \mid x_t)}_{\text{naive DC term}}.\] <p>The blue arrow shows the prior score \(s*\theta(x_t,t)\), which pulls \(x_t\) back to the manifold, while the orange arrow is the guidance vector pointing towards the target. Because this guidance is defined in the ambient space, it typically has a large normal component and <strong>pushes the trajectory off the manifold</strong>. As a result, the two forces frequently oppose each other (“guidance fights prior”), leading to zig-zag trajectories that cut across low-density regions and visibly leave \(M_0\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prior + Jacobian-guided likelihood (right).</strong> In the third panel we use the Tweedie denoiser \(\hat x_0(x_t,t)\) as a clean-space anchor, compute the <strong>clean-space measurement gradient</strong> \(\nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0)\) at \(x_0 = \hat x_0\), and then map it back to the noisy space via the Jacobian:</p> \[\nabla_{x_t}\log p(y \mid x_t) \;\approx\; J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)\, \nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0)\Big|_{x_0=\hat x_0(x_t,t)}.\] <p>As argued in the previous subsection, the Jacobian \(J_{\hat x_0}(x_t)\) behaves like a <strong>projection onto the tangent space</strong> \(T_{\hat x_0} M_0\). In the animation, this means the orange guidance arrow is no longer allowed to point arbitrarily into the ambient space: it is projected to lie <strong>along the manifold</strong>, while the blue prior score keeps \(x_t\) attached to \(M_0\). The resulting posterior-guided trajectory slides along the sine curve toward the target, achieving data consistency <em>without</em> drifting away from the learned generative manifold.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This toy example illustrates the core role of the Jacobian term in posterior-guided sampling: it converts a clean-space likelihood gradient into a noisy-space correction that is automatically constrained to the tangent space of the data manifold. In practice, this allows us to approximate the posterior score as</p> \[\nabla_{x_t}\log p(x_t \mid y) \;\approx\; s_\theta(x_t,t) \;+\; J_{\hat x_0}^\top(x_t)\, \nabla_{x_0}\log p(y \mid x_0),\] <p>so that the prior and likelihood contribute <strong>compatible</strong> vector fields—one keeps us on the manifold, the other moves us along it toward solutions that both match the measurements and remain realistic under the diffusion prior.</p> <h2 id="4-local-map-optimization-paradigm">4. Local-MAP optimization Paradigm</h2> <p>The posterior-guided sampling paradigm views inverse problems as a <strong>sampling task</strong>: we try to simulate a posterior diffusion process in noisy space and read off samples from $p(\mathbf{x}_0 \mid \mathbf{y})$ at $t = 0$.

Toy Illustration: Local-MAP as Denoise–Optimize–Re-noise</h3> <p>To make the local-MAP paradigm concrete, we build a simple 2D toy example and visualize one full reverse trajectory as an animation, see Animation 3.</p> <p>We place clean data on a 1D “sine-wave” manifold \(M_0 = \{(u, \sin u): u \in \mathbb{R}\}\) (Please note that $M_0$ refers to $M_{\text{DM}}$), which plays the role of a toy diffusion prior: clean samples concentrate near this curve. The forward operator is a 1D linear measurement \(\mathbf{A} = [\cos\phi,\; \sin\phi],\) so the set of points consistent with a given measurement \(y\) forms a <strong>slanted observation line</strong></p> \[M_{\mathrm{obs}} = \{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = y\}.\] <p>We pick a ground-truth point \(\mathbf{x}_0^\star \in M_0\) and set \(y = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0^\star\), so the red star in the animation marks the intersection \(M_0 \cap M_{\mathrm{obs}}\) — the ideal MAP solution.</p> <p>The purple curve traces the noisy trajectory \(\{\mathbf{x}_t\}_{t=1\to 0}\). We initialize it at a point far away from \(\mathbf{x}_0^\star\) in the upper-right corner. As the reverse process proceeds, the trajectory gradually bends towards the red star, illustrating how repeated local-MAP updates can still recover the correct solution even without solving a global optimization problem.</p> <p>Each reverse-time step in the animation is decomposed into three colored moves, directly mirroring the <strong>denoise–optimize–re-noise</strong> structure in Sec. 4.2: <strong>Purple (\(x_t\))</strong> represents current noisy state, <strong>Blue (\(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_0\))</strong> represents Tweedie denoising anchor, <strong>Orange (\(\mathbf{x}_0^\mathrm{local}\))</strong> represents local MAP refinement in clean space, and finally, we re-noise \(\mathbf{x}_0^\mathrm{local}\) to obtain the next noisy state <strong>Purple (\(x_{t-1}\))</strong>.</p> <figure class="figure"> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-diffusion-inverse-problems/local_map_2d_slanted_obs.gif" alt="Posterior-guided sampling: prior vs naive guidance vs Jacobian guidance" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; image-rendering: auto;"/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Animation 3: Clean-space local-MAP as a denoise–optimize–re-noise scheme. </div> <p>To complement the static 2D toy example, we provide an interactive 3D visualization of the <strong>clean-space Local-MAP paradigm</strong> (see the following Interactive Figure). The blue bowl-shaped surface represents the diffusion prior manifold \(M_{\mathrm{DM}}\), modeled here as an anisotropic Gaussian energy landscape. The light orange plane is the observation manifold \(M_{\mathrm{obs}}\), corresponding to a one-dimensional linear measurement operator \(y = A x\). Their intersection encodes the ideal posterior manifold where both the generative prior and the data-consistency constraint are satisfied.</p> <p>The black curve shows a full <strong>reverse-diffusion trajectory</strong> ({x_t}_{t=T}^{0}) in the clean space. You can type an integer (t) into the input box above the figure to inspect a single reverse step. For each selected time step (t), the visualization highlights the three sub-steps of the Local-MAP update:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A <strong>green segment</strong> connects the current noisy point \(x_t\) to its Tweedie-denoised anchor \(\hat{x}_0^{t}\).</p> </li> <li> <p>A <strong>red segment</strong> connects \(\hat{x}_0^{t}\) to the Local-MAP solution \(\hat{x}_0^{t,*}\).</p> </li> <li> <p>A <strong>blue segment</strong> connects \(\hat{x}_0^{t,*}\) to the next noisy iterate \(x_{t-1}\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>By rotating the 3D view and sweeping \(t\) from large values down to small ones, one can see how Local-MAP repeatedly nudges the reverse trajectory toward the intersection of \(\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{DM}}\) and \(\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{obs}}\) while staying faithful to the diffusion prior.</p> <div class="l-page"> <iframe src="/2026/assets/html/2026-04-27-diffusion-inverse-problems/local_map_interactive.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="600px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Interactive Figure: Local-MAP as Denoise–Optimize–Re-noise.

Conclusion</h2> <p>In this post, we examined diffusion priors for inverse problems through two complementary paradigms: <strong>Posterior-Guided Sampling</strong> and <strong>Local-MAP Optimization</strong>. While the landscape of diffusion inverse solvers is vast <d-dict key="daras2024survey"></d-dict> — including methods based on Variational Inference (VI) <d-cite key="mardani2023variational,alkan2023variational"></d-cite>, latent space optimization <d-cite key="daras2022score,wang2024dmplug"></d-cite>, and asymptotically exact MCMC/SMC approaches <d-cite key="wu2024principled,dou2024diffusion"></d-cite> – but we focused on these two because they have become the most practical and widely used ways to turn a powerful unconditional diffusion model into a plug-and-play inverse solver.</p> <p>At a high level, both paradigms realize the same philosophy:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p><strong>Decouple the generative prior from the measurement physics.</strong></p> </aside> <p>Once a diffusion prior has been trained (once and for all) on natural signals, we can pair it with an arbitrary forward operator \(\mathbf{A}\) and noise model to solve tasks as diverse as inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, and CT reconstruction – without retraining the generative model. What changes from task to task is not the diffusion backbone, but <strong>how we combine a prior operator with a data-consistency operator</strong>.</p> <h3 id="51-posterior-guided-sampling-gradient-based-flows-in-noisy-space">5.1. Posterior-guided sampling: gradient-based flows in noisy space</h3> <p>The posterior-guided paradigm keeps the reverse diffusion entirely in the noisy space \(\mathbf{x}_t\). By replacing the prior score field with the posterior score (Eq. \eqref{eq:posterior_score}), the reverse PF-ODE becomes a gradient-like flow along \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log p(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{y})\). The posterior score can be decomposed into two parts, namely the prior score and the likelihood score, this makes posterior-guided sampling look like an <strong>operator splitting</strong> scheme in noisy space: at each step we follow the diffusion prior flow and then apply a data-consistency correction that has been carefully projected onto the manifold’s tangent space.</p> <p>From this perspective, methods such as DPS/DMPS and MCG can be viewed as different instantiations of the same template: they are <strong>gradient-based posterior flows</strong> that operate directly on \(\mathbf{x}_t\).</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Strengths.</strong> Conceptually close to Bayesian posterior sampling; naturally produces <strong>multiple diverse reconstructions</strong> and can, in principle, approximate the full posterior \(p(\mathbf{x}_0\mid \mathbf{y})\). Works well with non-linear or differentiable black-box forward models, as long as we can backpropagate to obtain a likelihood gradient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> Accurate likelihood-score approximations typically require <strong>Jacobian–vector products (JVP) through the Tweedie denoiser</strong>, on top of standard forward passes. This increases memory and compute, especially at high resolution. The dynamics can also be sensitive to guidance strength and discretization; if the likelihood term is not geometrically aligned (e.g. without the Jacobian projection), it may fight against the prior instead of flowing along the data manifold.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="52-local-map-optimization-denoiseoptimizere-noise-in-clean-space">5.2. Local-MAP optimization: denoise–optimize–re-noise in clean space</h3> <p>The local-MAP paradigm instead views inverse problems as a sequence of <strong>small optimization problems in the clean space</strong> \(\mathbf{x}_0\), this yields a clean-space <strong>denoise–optimize–re-noise</strong> operator splitting. The prior trajectory (Steps 1 and 3) depends only on the unconditional diffusion model, while the inner optimization (Step 2) depends only on the measurement model and our choice of local objective and solver.</p> <p>Under this view, seemingly different methods – including DDS, DDRM, DiffusionMBIR, and various PnP/RED-style algorithms – can be unified as instances of the same <strong>local-MAP optimization template</strong> with different choices of surrogate, solver, and re-noising schedule.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Strengths.</strong> Recasts each reverse step as a <strong>standard optimization problem in \(\mathbf{x}_0\)</strong>, allowing us to leverage decades of work on quadratic solvers, Krylov methods, and proximal algorithms. Avoids noisy-space JVPs entirely: all gradients live in clean space or through \(\mathbf{A}\). Naturally targets <strong>MAP-like reconstructions</strong>, which is often exactly what practitioners want in imaging applications.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> The method is only <strong>locally</strong> MAP: it relies on Tweedie anchors and quadratic surrogates remaining faithful to the true posterior landscape in a neighborhood. Solving a local subproblem at every step (e.g. via CG) can be costly for large-scale 3D problems or complex \(\mathbf{A}\). By construction it is mode-seeking, and does not explore the full posterior without additional machinery.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="53-decoupling-as-the-main-design-principle">5.3. Decoupling as the main design principle</h3> <p>Despite these differences, both paradigms share the same structural core:</p> <aside class="l-body box-note"> <p><strong>A diffusion prior operator that proposes plausible samples, and a data-consistency operator that enforces the physics.</strong></p> </aside> <p>Posterior-guided methods implement this decoupling directly in noisy space via a posterior score field, while local-MAP methods implement it in clean space via Tweedie anchors and trust-region MAP updates. This decoupling is what makes diffusion priors so attractive for real-world inverse problems: once the prior is trained, we can adapt to new measurement operators and noise models largely by changing <strong>how</strong> we plug in the data-consistency operator, rather than retraining the model.</p> <h3 id="54-limitations-and-outlook">5.4. Limitations and Outlook</h3> <p>Although both paradigms are elegant from theoretically and practically perspective, they rely on approximations (Tweedie denoising, score-to-likelihood projections, local quadratic surrogates). When these approximations break (strongly ill-posed settings, heavy nonlinearity, severe out-of-distribution measurements), performance can degrade in ways that are hard to diagnose. In addition, the computation cost is also a problem that cannot be ignored, posterior-guided methods can be dominated by JVP/gradient cost; local-MAP can be dominated by per-step inner solves—either way, iterative sampling is often the bottleneck.</p> <p>Looking forward, several frontiers remain active in this area:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Hybrid schemes.</strong> Combine global exploration (posterior-guided at high noise) with sharp refinement (local-MAP near \(t\!\to\!0\)).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Beyond linear–Gaussian models.</strong> Most current theory assumes \(\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0 + \mathbf{n}\) with Gaussian noise. Extending these paradigms to non-linear, non-Gaussian, or partially unknown forward models is still challenging.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acceleration and distillation.</strong> Iterative sampling remains expensive. Distillation, consistency models, and related techniques offer promising ways to compress these multi-step procedures into a few learned updates while preserving their geometric structure.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Our hope is that the geometric and probabilistic lens developed in this blog – posterior-guided flows in noisy space, and local-MAP optimization in clean space – can serve as a compact mental model for navigating the rapidly growing literature on diffusion-based inverse problems, and as a design toolkit for building the next generation of robust and reusable inverse solvers.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blogpost develops a geometric and probabilistic lens on diffusion priors for inverse problems.

However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag.

These agents can <em>read</em> the world through managed context pipelines (ingesting documents, code, sensor data) and <em>write</em> to the world via APIs and tools, while continually improving themselves by incorporating new training data (experience) into their weights. As AI systems begin to perform economically valuable tasks across domains <d-cite key="erol2025cost,ide2024artificial,hadfield2025economy,handa2025economic"></d-cite>, from writing <d-cite key="choi-etal-2024-combining"></d-cite> and software development <d-cite key="chen2025textsuperscript,Miserendino2025"></d-cite> to customer service <d-cite key="liu2025evaluating,ackerman2025perceptions"></d-cite> and healthcare <d-cite key="Arora2025,gallifant2025beyond"></d-cite>, there is a pressing need to rigorously measure their performance, value, and risks in terms that organizations can understand and trust.</p> <p>Recent analyses of millions of AI usage instances show that AI is already touching a wide range of occupations, with particularly heavy use in software development and writing tasks (together nearly half of all usage) <d-cite key="Handa2025"></d-cite>. Notably, around 36% of occupations see at least a quarter of their tasks involving AI assistance <d-cite key="Handa2025"></d-cite> – but in most cases this is <em>augmentation</em> (AI helping a human) rather than full automation. Indeed, one study found 57% of AI usage suggests human-AI collaboration (learning or iterating on an output) vs. 43% where the AI essentially completes tasks autonomously <d-cite key="Handa2025"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the capabilities of frontier models have been climbing rapidly. In high-stakes domains like medicine, open-ended physician-written evaluations (HealthBench) show model performance improving from 16% (GPT-3.5) to 32% (GPT-4) and up to 60% with the latest models <d-cite key="Arora2025"></d-cite> within two years – a nearly 4x improvement. In software engineering, new benchmarks of freelance programming tasks (SWE-Lancer) valued at \$1M found that state-of-the-art models can now complete a significant subset of real-world coding jobs (earning about \$400k of the \$1M total value) <d-cite key="Miserendino2025"></d-cite>, though they still fail on the majority of tasks. We are entering what Silver and Sutton term the <em>Era of Experience</em> <d-cite key="SilverSutton2025"></d-cite>, where AI agents learn continuously from real-world interactions rather than solely from static training data.</p> <p><strong>Contributions.</strong> We present an expanded <strong>AI Fundamentals</strong> framework that maps every technical aspect of an AI agent’s performance into the language of economics and public-company finance <d-cite key="bai2025review,garrido2024deep,erol2025cost"></d-cite>. Our goal is to define a single unifying metric – <strong>Agent Economic Value (AEV)</strong> – which collapses all performance aspects into one cash–flow based expression:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \text{AEV} &amp; = \text{Cost Saving} + \text{Efficiency Premium} - \text{Model Cost} \\ &amp;- \text{Data Cost} - \text{Human Intervention Cost}. \end{aligned}\] <ol> <li>We formalise AEV and map each cost or benefit term to GAAP <d-cite key="GAAP"></d-cite> line items, with empirical evidence showing the full expression is measurable today.</li> <li>We provide a measurement methodology validated on software, healthcare, and enterprise usage datasets.</li> <li>We extend the template to the “Era of Experience” where agents learn from grounded, real-world reward streams <d-cite key="SilverSutton2025"></d-cite>.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Data–Asset Valuation.</strong> Interaction logs generated during agent operation accrue as an <em>intangible data asset</em> <d-cite key=" moon-etal-2025-limacost,yanggmvaluator,zhang2025fairshare"></d-cite>. Under GAAP we expense collection and cleaning costs immediately, but we may capitalise the curated corpus once it demonstrably improves future cash flows (analogous to software development costs that pass technological feasibility). The same treatment applies under IFRS (IAS 38), where the asset is amortised over the useful life of the model. We therefore track a “Data R&amp;D” line item that migrates to the balance-sheet once the corpus clears the feasibility gate, providing an auditable bridge from token spend to book value.</p> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <figure style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-economic-agents/economic-value.png" style="width: 40%;"/> <figcaption style="font-size: 1em;">Figure 1: Graphical breakdown of Agent Economic Value (AEV) into positive cash inflows (Cost Saving and Efficiency Premium) versus negative outflows (Model, Data, and Human Intervention Costs).</figcaption> </figure> <h3 id="from-tasks-to-cash-flows">From Tasks to Cash Flows</h3> <p>A <em>task</em> is the atomic unit defined by O<em>NET.

MCP servers provide read/write primitives; GPU clusters host training &amp; inference.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The architecture includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Observer (Read) Paths:</strong> The agent ingests context through managed pipelines (MCP-Read). These could be <em>pull-based</em> queries or <em>push-based</em> streams of information.</li> <li><strong>Actuator (Write) Paths:</strong> The agent produces outputs via actions (MCP-Write), generating text or calling tools/APIs to enact changes in the environment.</li> <li><strong>Agent Core (LLM + Controller):</strong> The large model that processes inputs and decides on outputs, implementing a policy $\pi$ in an RL sense.</li> <li><strong>Learning (Weight Updates):</strong> After tasks are completed, interaction data can be fed back into training pipelines (DL-TRAIN) to update model weights.</li> </ul> <p>Everything is orchestrated by a <strong>Managed Compute &amp; Prompt (MCP) service</strong>, which coordinates reads and writes and provides an interface to the agent.</p> <h3 id="resource-taxonomy-and-marginal-valuation">Resource Taxonomy and Marginal Valuation</h3> <p>Data are <em>non-fungible</em> assets whose worth is governed by their <em>quality</em> rather than sheer volume <d-cite key="moon-etal-2025-limacost,yanggmvaluator,zhang2025fairshare"></d-cite>. We track four economically distinct subclasses:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Expert Time</strong> – manually crafted demonstrations, ratings, or critiques by domain specialists.</li> <li><strong>Live-Environment Experience</strong> – interaction traces collected during real production usage.</li> <li><strong>Inference Data Stream</strong> – prompts and completions logged on-the-fly at inference time.</li> <li><strong>Training Dataset</strong> – the curated corpus used for pre-training or fine-tuning.</li> </ol> <p>The <strong>Model &amp; Compute</strong> layer is priced <em>per inference token</em>. Beyond raw compute, we include a <em>model premium</em>: the price gap between a proprietary frontier model and the best open-source alternative delivering similar quality.</p> <p><strong>Machine Skills</strong> achievable today include coding, deep financial research, and multi-modal artistic generation. Their marginal contribution is reflected in <em>Cost Saving</em> and <em>Efficiency Premium</em>. Conversely, <strong>Human Skills</strong> are either replaced or augmented, with any residual oversight captured by the <em>Human Intervention Cost</em> term.</p> <p>Putting these pieces together, the updated AI Fundamental identity is</p> \[\begin{aligned} \text{AEV} &amp;= \text{Cost Saving} + \text{Efficiency Premium} - \text{Model Cost} \\ &amp;- \text{Data Cost} - \text{Human Intervention Cost}, \end{aligned}\] <p>where Model Cost $=$ (inference compute token cost) $+$ model premium, and all terms are measured on a <em>marginal</em> per-task basis.</p> <h3 id="metric-definitions">Metric Definitions</h3> <p>The above Equation defines AEV with explicit cost fields.</p> \[\begin{aligned} \text{AEV} &amp;= \sum_{i \in T}\!\bigl(\text{CostSaving}_i + \text{EfficiencyPremium}_i\bigr) \\ &amp;- \text{ModelCost}_i - \text{DataCost}_i - \text{HumanInterventionCost}_i. \end{aligned}\] <p>We can also express Agent Economic Value with more detailed cost components:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \text{Agent Economic Value} &amp;= \text{Cost Saving} + \text{Efficiency Premium} \\ &amp;- (C_{\text{GPU}} + C_{\text{energy}} + C_{\text{MCP}} + C_{\text{human}} + C_{\text{data}}) \end{aligned}\] <p>Here, the cost components can be broken down further: $C_{\text{GPU}}$ encompasses expenses for GPUs and other accelerators; $C_{\text{energy}}$ includes power consumption and associated infrastructure like cooling systems; $C_{\text{data}}$ covers the often substantial lifecycle costs of data (acquisition, storage, processing, and ongoing curation), which forms the foundation for the agent’s learning and performance; $C_{\text{MCP}}$ pertains to the managed compute and prompt orchestration services, which can also factor in costs related to algorithmic complexity or specific software; and $C_{\text{human}}$ is the cost of necessary human oversight and intervention.</p> <p><strong>GAAP mapping.</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Cost Saving</strong> $\to$ Operating expense reduction</li> <li><strong>Efficiency Premium</strong> $\to$ Incremental revenue or throughput uplift</li> <li><strong>Model, Data, Human Intervention Costs</strong> $\to$ Cost of goods sold / operating expenses</li> <li><strong>AEV</strong> $\to$ Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT)</li> </ul> <h3 id="efficiency-premium">Efficiency Premium</h3> <p>The Efficiency Premium captures the top-line growth or productivity gain from AI – not just doing the same work for cheaper, but doing <em>more</em> or <em>better</em> with AI than before. This metric recognizes that AI agents can operate at superhuman speed and scale when reliable, potentially generating additional revenue or throughput.</p> <p>Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Customer support AI handling hundreds of chats concurrently compared to a human’s 5 chats</li> <li>Healthcare where AI can engage with patients who otherwise wouldn’t get attention</li> <li>Software development cycles becoming faster, allowing teams to tackle more ambitious projects</li> </ul> <p>The Efficiency Premium often remains latent until human-intervention costs are brought under control. Once the AI is reliable enough (failures are very rare), it can be scaled almost without limit and the premium can accumulate unabated. When intervention costs trend toward zero the negative terms vanish, allowing the Efficiency Premium to accumulate without bound.</p> <h2 id="measurement-methodology">Measurement Methodology</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Task Extraction.</strong> For unstructured chat logs we apply Clio’s embedding+pattern pipeline (DP noise $\epsilon=0.5$) <d-cite key="Handa2025"></d-cite>.</li> <li><strong>Dollar Valuation.</strong> <ul> <li><em>Software</em>: Upwork median payout $\tilde{p}=$ \$500; full ticket pool \$1M <d-cite key="Miserendino2025"></d-cite>.</li> <li><em>Healthcare</em>: average avoided readmission saves \$12,000 (CMS FY-24); multiply HealthBench rubric score by that coefficient <d-cite key="Arora2025"></d-cite>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Human-Intervention Logging.</strong> Tag manual edits, escalations, or tool fallbacks.

As argued by Silver &amp; Sutton, the focus is shifting towards agents that learn from <em>experience</em> by optimizing for grounded rewards directly tied to economic outcomes like profit, or operational metrics like latency <d-cite key="lin2025stop"></d-cite>, rather than relying solely on static human feedback <d-cite key="SilverSutton2025"></d-cite>. The core idea is to define the agent’s objective function in terms of our framework’s value metrics. The total return $G_t$ at a given step $t$ is the sum of immediate economic contributions, $G_t = \text{CostSaving}_t + \text{EfficiencyPremium}_t$. The agent’s learning problem then becomes maximizing the expected cumulative discounted Agent Economic Value over an infinite horizon:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \max_\pi \mathbb{E}\Biggl[ &amp; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k ( (\text{CostSaving}_{t+k} + \text{EfficiencyPremium}_{t+k}) - \\ &amp; \text{ModelCost}_{t+k} - \text{DataCost}_{t+k} - \text{HumanInterventionCost}_{t+k} ) \Biggr]. \end{aligned}\] <p>Here, the agent’s policy $\pi$ is learned to maximize this sum, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor; each term directly reflects measurable economic impact of the agent’s actions.</p> <p>A critical factor for successful RL-driven development is the creation of high-fidelity <em>simulation environments</em>. These environments must closely mirror the specific real-world scenarios in which the agent will operate, including the nuances of tasks, data distributions, and potential failure modes. By interacting with such well-crafted environments (effectively digital twins of operational realities), an agent can rapidly accumulate a vast amount of experience, far exceeding what is feasible with direct real-world interaction alone or from static datasets. For instance, AlphaProof achieved superhuman problem-solving by generating 100 million proofs through interaction with a dedicated proof environment, starting from an initial seed of 100k human proofs <d-cite key="SilverSutton2025"></d-cite>.</p> <p>This RL-driven, experience-based learning paradigm is central to achieving the long-run vision: an agent with consistently high Agent Economic Value. Such an agent continuously expands its capabilities—thereby raising Cost Saving and the Efficiency Premium—while actively learning to keep intervention costs negligible through ongoing adaptation and refinement within its operational or simulated domain. The key is not just the RL algorithms themselves, but the synergy between these algorithms and rich, representative environments that enable effective and accelerated learning.</p> <h2 id="future-outlook-agentic-liquidity-and-the-mcp-wallet">Future Outlook: Agentic Liquidity and The MCP Wallet</h2> <p>The current AEV equation assumes the agent works with fixed resources. However, as agents move toward full autonomy, we must extend the framework to include <strong>Agentic Liquidity</strong>. This is the ability of the agent to hold and spend capital—”MCP form money”—to complete tasks.</p> <h3 id="the-problem-closed-resource-loops">The Problem: Closed Resource Loops</h3> <p>Currently, if an agent lacks a specific tool or data source (e.g., a real-time Bloomberg terminal feed or a paid API for specialized protein folding), it fails or reports to a human.

Being one of the most cited papers in regularized methods for continual learning, this blogpost disentangles the underlying concept of the proposed objective function. We assume that the reader is aware of the basic terminologies of continual learning.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Following are the notations used throughout this blogpost. Vectors and matrices are denoted in bold lowercase and bold uppercase, respectively. Superscript $^{\top}$ denotes matrix transpose. \(\mathbb{E}[\cdot]\) denotes the expectation operator. An optimum value of a variable is denoted by adding a superscript $^{\star}$.</p> <p>Continual learning is a much desired attribute for neural networks. For example, if we train a model to distinguish between images of a cat and a dog (task 1), and subsequently train it again to distinguish between images of chair and table (task 2), the model should be able to retain its knowledge on task 1 even after learning task 2. In simple terms, our network model should be able to perform equally well on all seen tasks, even after learning new ones. Any degradation of performance on the previous tasks after learning new ones is fittingly termed as <em>catastrophic forgetting</em>. This sub-research area has seen an insurgence in works in recent times <d-cite key="kirkpatrick2017overcoming,zenke2017continual,li2017learning,aljundi2018memory"></d-cite>. Briefly, the continual learning scenarios can be categorized into following <d-cite key="van2019three"></d-cite>:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Task-Incremental Learning</strong>: For the given set of tasks, the task identity is known during testing.</li> <li><strong>Domain-Incremental Learning</strong>: For the given set of tasks, task identity is not provided during testing, but need not infer the same.</li> <li><strong>Class-Incremental Learning</strong>: For the given set of tasks, task identity is not provided during testing, but has to infer the same.</li> </ul> <p>We highly recommend <d-cite key="van2019three,wiewel2019localizing"></d-cite> for a good overview of different methodologies to alleviate catastrophic forgetting as well as continual learning in general. The next Section describes the well studied regularization method of continual learning: Elastic Weight Consolidation. It presents a solution to the continual learning problem by making task-specific synaptic (<em>read</em> network parameters) consolidation. Based on the theory of plasticity of post-synaptic dendritic spines in the brain, this method presents a paradigm that marks how important is a network parameter to the previous tasks and penalizes any change made to it depending upon the importance, while learning new tasks.</p> <h2 id="elastic-weight-consolidation">Elastic Weight Consolidation</h2> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="75%" height="auto" title="Possible configurations of θ*_A" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Possible configurations of</strong> $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$.

Training DNNs generates a mapping between the input distribution space and target distribution space. This is done by finding out an optimum \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star\) which results in the least error in the training objective. It has been shown in earlier works <d-cite key="sussmann1992uniqueness"></d-cite> that such a mapping can be obtained with many configurations of $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$, represented in the figure above. The term <em>many configurations</em> can be interpreted as a solution space around the most optimum $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ with acceptable error in the learned mapping. Note that in figures to follow, the shaded ellipses represent the solution of individual tasks where as the overlapping region of multiple ellipses, marked by diagonal lines, represents the common solution space for all tasks.</p> <p>Let’s begin with a simple case of two tasks, task $\mathcal{A}$ and task $\mathcal{B}$. To have a configuration of parameters that performs well for both $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, the network should be able to pick $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ from the overlapping region of the individual solution spaces (see Figure 2). This is with the assumption that there is always an overlapping region for the solution spaces of all tasks for the network to learn them sequentially. A case of four tasks has been illustrated in Figure 2. In the first instance, the network can learn any \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\mathcal{A}}\) that performs well for task $\mathcal{A}$. But with the arrival of task $\mathcal{B}$, the network should pick up a \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}}\).</p> <p>The next question that arrives is how can the network learn the a set of parameters that lies in this overlapping region. To this end, EWC presents a method of selective regularization of parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. After learning $\mathcal{A}$, this regularization method identifies which parameters are important for $\mathcal{A}$, and then penalizes any change made to the network parameters according to their importance while learning $\mathcal{B}$.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="75%" height="auto" title="Overlap of possible configurations of θ*" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Overlap of possible configurations of</strong> $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$.

More specifically given the data $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, we want to learn the posterior probability distribution function $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})$. Following <d-cite key="lherranz2018rotating"></d-cite> and using Bayes rule, we can write</p> <p>\begin{equation} \underbrace{p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})}_{\text{posterior}} = \dfrac{\overbrace{p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})}^{\text{likelihood}}\overbrace{p(\boldsymbol{\theta})}^{\text{prior}}}{p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})} \end{equation}</p> <p>Since maximizing a function is same as maximizing its logarithm, we take \(\log(\cdot)\) of the above equation as follows:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) +\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta})) - \log(p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) \end{equation}</p> <p>To train the neural network on $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, the objective function to be optimized over the log-likelihood function:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \text{argmax}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma}))} \end{equation}</p> <p>For the case of given two independent tasks such that \(\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}\}\) (with $\mathcal{B}$ appearing in sequence after $\mathcal{A}$), the log-posterior can be written as:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) +\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})) - \log(p(\mathcal{B})) \end{equation} where the independence of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is used. Following the Bayesian formulation, $p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the loss for current task $\mathcal{B}$, $p(\mathcal{B})$ is the likelihood for $\mathcal{B}$, and now posterior $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$ for $\mathcal{A}$ becomes prior for $\mathcal{B}$.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-elastic-weight-consolidation-nuts-bolts/fig3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Laplace approximation of true posterior pdf" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Laplace approximation of true posterior pdf.</strong> $\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}$ represents the Fisher Information matrix. </div> <p>Referring to the log-posterior equation, it can be observed that we have to deal with the function $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$. This is the posterior function for $\mathcal{A}$ which contains the information about the parameters that explain $\mathcal{A}$ using the given network. As discussed in <d-cite key="kirkpatrick2017overcoming"></d-cite>, this posterior function is said to be intractable. Basically, the intractability of $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$ can be interpreted as the function not existing in some interpretable form. Hence, it is difficult to estimate its quantiles. See <d-cite key="tokdar2013lecture"></d-cite> for an example.</p> <p>Next as the posterior is difficult to analyze in its present form, we aim to approximate it using Laplace approximation. In simple terms, Laplace approximation methodology is employed to find a normal distribution approximation to a continuous probability density distribution (see Figure 3). Assuming $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$ is smooth and majorly peaked around its point of maxima (i.e. $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$), we can approximate it with a normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$ and variance $[\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}]^{-1}$. This brings us to the question on how did we come to the conclusion on these particular values of mean and variance for the normal distribution.</p> <p>To begin with, compute the second order Taylor expansion of $\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ around $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$ as follows:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) +( \dfrac{\partial\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top(\dfrac{\partial^2\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \text{(higher order terms)} \end{equation}</p> <p>Neglecting higher order terms and noting that \(\dfrac{\partial\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}} = 0\) (slope of tangent at peak), we have:</p> \[\begin{align} \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top\underbrace{(\dfrac{\partial^2\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})}_{\text{Hessian}}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) \end{align}\] <p>Using the log-posterior equation, we can write the above for task $\mathcal{A}$ as following:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})) = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}\mid\mathcal{A})) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top(\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \Delta \end{equation}</p> <p>where \(\Delta = \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}\mid\mathcal{A}))\). Next, write</p> <p>\begin{equation} (\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}) = -((-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})^{-1})^{-1} \end{equation}</p> <p>and replace it back in the equation to express the same in the standard form of normal distribution function:</p> <p>\begin{equation} p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A}) = \epsilon\exp(-\dfrac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top((-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})^{-1})^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})) \end{equation}</p> <p>where \(\epsilon = \exp(\Delta)\) is a constant. From this equation, it can be concluded that we have obtained the Laplace approximation of posterior pdf as:</p> <p>\begin{equation} p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})\sim\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}, (-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})^{-1}) \end{equation}</p> <p>Notice the variance of the estimated normal distribution of $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$. Given $\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}$, the term $\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A}))$ represents the log-likelihood of posterior pdf $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})$. Clearly, the term represents the inverse of <strong>Fisher information matrix</strong> (FIM),</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathbb{E}[-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}] \end{equation}\] <p>Note that we obtain $\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}$ by using the Bayesian equation and treating the prior $p(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and $p(\mathcal{A})$ constant. This makes derivative of log of the Bayesian equation posterior and likelihood equal. More on this in <strong>Appendix A.2</strong> of <d-cite key="van2019three"></d-cite>. Finally, we get</p> <p>\begin{equation} p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})\sim\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}, [\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}]^{-1}) \end{equation}</p> <p>Further, as FIM can also be computed from first order derivatives, we can avoid the Hessian computed in the Taylor expansion using the following property <d-cite key="kay1993fundamentals"></d-cite>:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathbb{E}[-\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}] = \mathbb{E}[(\dfrac{\partial(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}})(\dfrac{\partial(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}})^\top\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}}] \end{equation}\] <p>Now, we can write the log-posterior equation as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) +\dfrac{\lambda}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top(\dfrac{\partial^2(\log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\mathcal{A})))}{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mid_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}})(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \epsilon' \end{equation}\] <p>where $\epsilon’$ accounts for all constants and $\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter introduced to have a trade off between learning $\mathcal{B}$ and not forgetting $\mathcal{A}$. Simplifying more, we have:</p> \[\begin{equation} \log(p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\mid\boldsymbol{\Sigma})) = \log(p(\mathcal{B}\mid\boldsymbol{\theta})) - \dfrac{\lambda}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} - \boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}} (\boldsymbol{\theta} - \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}}) + \epsilon' \end{equation}\] <p>This implies: \(\begin{equation} \underbrace{\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})}_{\text{overall loss}} = \underbrace{\ell_\mathcal{B}(\boldsymbol{\theta})}_{\text{loss for \mathcal{B} }} - \underbrace{\dfrac{\lambda}{2}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})^\top\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}(\boldsymbol{\theta} -\boldsymbol{ \theta}^\star_{\mathcal{A}})}_{\text{weight regularizer}} + \epsilon' \end{equation}\)</p> <p>Further simplification can be found in <d-cite key="van2019three"></d-cite>. Before we end this Section, let’s discuss how does the FIM indicates the <strong>importance</strong> of the parameters for the previous tasks.</p> <p>We say a network has learnt a task when its objective has reached a minimum in the loss surface. We know that the curvature of such surfaces represent the sensitivity of the network with respect to the optimum $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$. This sensitivity can be determined by looking at the direction along which $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$ changes. This implies the curvature is inversely proportional to change in $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$. Hence, if the more the curvature, a ‘$\delta$’ increment can result in large increase in the loss. Curvature of a curve is denoted by its Hessian and hence in our case, as the second derivative is of the log likelihood function of the posterior pdf, the FIM \(\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}\) comes into picture. Thus, \(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}\) can tell us which parameter is important to the the previous task as its corresponding element in \(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{A}\) will have a large value, indicating higher importance.

For example, the case of the Piltdown Man, where researchers selectively (mis-)reported crucial contextual details, misled evolutionary sciences for decades <d-cite key="vincent1999piltdown"></d-cite>. Lack of reporting standards can also lead to confusion, even when everyone acts in good faith. To illustrate, in 19th-century chemistry, the lack of agreed conventions on atomic weights left the field in chaos, with the same compounds appearing under conflicting formulas, until the Karlsruhe Congress established common standards <d-cite key="ihde1961karlsruhe"></d-cite>. These (and other similar) episodes <d-cite key="goldacre2009bad"></d-cite> instill the same lesson: without reliable reporting conventions, even important discoveries can distort rather than advance science.</p> <p>Evaluation - quantitative measurement of a model’s performance on a pre-defined task or benchmark - has long been one of the central means of assessing progress in NLP <d-cite key="jones1994towards, church2017emerging, church2019survey, bowman-dahl-2021-will, kiela-etal-2021-dynabench, sainz-etal-2023-nlp"></d-cite>. Despite this, our standards for reporting evaluations have not kept pace <d-cite key="bhatt2021case, belz-etal-2023-non, belz-etal-2025-standard, zhao-etal-2025-sphere"></d-cite>. Such a lack of standards becomes more concerning with the fast adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) by a wide range of stakeholders, many of whom are not experts and yet heavily depend on such systems to make decisions that impact real-world outcomes <d-cite key="araujo2020ai, bommasani2023holistic"></d-cite>. As LLMs become embedded in critical domains, responsible deployment is a key consideration <d-cite key="10536000, radanliev2024ethics, orr2024building,tripathi2025ethical"></d-cite> and a major part of this includes transparency on what a model can and cannot do. Based on a survey of recent research in the field of evaluation studies, we identify three critical problems stemming from current reporting practices: the <em>Reproducibility Crisis</em>, the <em>Accessibility Crisis</em>, and the <em>Governance Crisis</em>. We discuss why current efforts at transparency <d-cite key="mitchell2019model, gebru2021datasheets"></d-cite> need reconsideration. In light of such issues, we propose EvalCards: concise evaluation summaries which are (i) <em>easy to write</em>, (ii) <em>easy to understand</em>, and (iii) <em>hard to miss</em>. We present case studies of three popular models, showing how difficult it was to gather consistent evaluation details when creating sample EvalCards, and also discuss directions of future work.</p> <p>Our main argument is one for a shift in norms: evaluation reporting is not a marketing exercise but a core component of what it means to release a model responsibly. While the broader challenge of how to evaluate models remains open and complex <d-cite key="laskar2024systematic, chang2024survey, gao2025llm"></d-cite>, our focus here is narrower but nonetheless critical: improving how evaluations are reported. We hope this work sparks conversation and helps move the field toward a culture of more honest and actionable evaluation disclosure practices.</p> <h2 id="problems-with-evaluation-reporting">Problems with Evaluation Reporting</h2> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/eval_card_figure-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/eval_card_figure-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/eval_card_figure-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/eval_card_figure.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>To ground our analysis of problems in evaluation reporting in NLP and AI, we conducted a survey of recent work with systematic keyword searches related to evaluation and reporting (e.g., evaluation, reporting, disclosure, evaluation artifacts) in ACL Anthology, DBLP, and Google Scholar. We complemented this with a reverse snowball sampling from the most recent broad-scope seminal works in NLP evaluation as seeds <d-cite key="weidinger2025toward, gao2025llm,zhao-etal-2025-sphere,chang2024survey,laskar2024systematic,biderman2024lessons,burnell2023rethink, allen2021evaluation"></d-cite>. We then manually analyzed the works to extract recurring themes of discussion. From this, we identify three overarching crises of reproducibility, accessibility, and governance.</p> <h3 id="reproducibility-crisis">Reproducibility Crisis</h3> <p>In machine learning, the broader reproducibility crisis is well discussed <d-cite key="kapoor2023leakage"></d-cite> and also manifests in evaluation reporting <d-cite key="bouthillier2019unreproducible, dodge-etal-2019-show, belz-etal-2025-standard, zhao-etal-2025-sphere"></d-cite>. More specifically, in the context of model evaluations, prior work repeatedly highlights that published results often cannot be trusted without careful reconstruction of undocumented choices <d-cite key="belz-etal-2021-systematic,burnell2023rethink, belz-etal-2023-non, biderman2024lessons, belz-etal-2025-standard, zhao-etal-2025-sphere"></d-cite>. We conduct some case studies on some recent LLM model releases and discuss three such crucial details that are often inconsistent or missing from evaluation details:</p> <p><strong>Target Capability</strong> Model releases include benchmark names and scores, but can often fail to specify what each benchmark is intended to measure. This problem can be exacerbated for reported scores on large composite benchmarks such as SuperGLUE <d-cite key="wang2019superglue"></d-cite> or HELM <d-cite key="bommasani2023holistic"></d-cite> that aggregate tasks across domains and do not provide clarity, especially for non-experts, as to what capability is targeted.</p> <p><strong>Metric</strong> Reported scores frequently omit which evaluation metric was used, which makes it difficult to assess what a score reflects or to compare performance across models fairly <d-cite key="mizrahi2024state, hu2024unveiling"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Prompting Strategy</strong> Prompting, i.e, the way a query is structured and phrased for LLMs, is one of the most significant variables in model performance <d-cite key="hu2024unveiling, sclar2024quantifying, zhuo-etal-2024-prosa, chatterjee-etal-2024-posix"></d-cite>, yet is often absent from reported results. Also, the absence of consistent reporting on a common baseline strategy, such as zero-shot prompting, further hinders meaningful comparison across models <d-cite key="10.1145/3582269.3615599, ousidhoum-etal-2021-probing"></d-cite>.</p> <h3 id="accessibility-crisis">Accessibility Crisis</h3> <p>A recurring theme in relevant work is the highly fragmented nature of available information on models. Documentation frameworks such as Model Cards, DataSheets, and FactSheets were introduced precisely to improve accessibility of information about models <d-cite key="mitchell2019model, gebru2021datasheets, arnold2019factsheets, bhardwaj2024machine, luo2025lack"></d-cite>. However, even today, evaluation details are dispersed across academic papers, technical appendices, GitHub READMEs, HuggingFace model cards, and blog posts, each using different terminology and presentation styles. This scattered documentation makes it difficult to locate and compare the evaluation results. This has consequences for both researchers and users.</p> <p><strong>For Researchers</strong> When evaluation details are scattered across sources, they are easily overlooked or lost altogether. Important context, such as benchmark versions, question framing, or metric details, may never reach the researchers who rely on these results <d-cite key="belz-etal-2023-non,belz-thomson-2024-2024,belz-etal-2025-standard, belz-etal-2025-2025"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>For Users</strong> For non-technical users and decision-makers, the problem is compounded by selective reporting, where only strong benchmark results are emphasized or marketed in some sources, further reducing trust in evaluation claims <d-cite key="arnold2019factsheets"></d-cite>. As a result, users may struggle to select appropriate models, a challenge that becomes particularly critical in high-stakes or sensitive deployment contexts <d-cite key="huijgens2024help, 10.1145/3706598.3713240"></d-cite>.</p> <p>For evaluation to be actionable, it must be consistently visible and easily accessible. Without a standardized way to report evaluations in one place, users are left to piece together incomplete information, undermining efforts to assess a model’s suitability for deployment.</p> <h3 id="governance-crisis">Governance Crisis</h3> <p>AI legislations across the world today, from US to EU <d-cite key="edwards2021eu, act2024eu, sloane2025systematic, carey2025regulating"></d-cite> and from Singapore to China <d-cite key="pande2023navigating, roberts2021chinese, dong2024meta"></d-cite>, are increasingly concerned with transparency <d-cite key="larsson2020transparency, agrawal2024accountability"></d-cite> and reporting mandates <d-cite key="nagendran2020artificial, laux2024three"></d-cite>. Without standardized evaluation reports, governance of models faces three key problems:</p> <p><strong>Risk Assessment</strong> It becomes challenging to determine model risks when the evaluation methods are not clearly reported <d-cite key="hogan2021ethics, novelli2024taking, reuel2024betterbench, reuel2024open"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Algorithmic Accountability</strong> When developers can selectively report results or omit critical weaknesses, it makes it difficult for external reviewers or regulators to hold systems to consistent standards <d-cite key="shah2018algorithmic, wieringa2020account, horneber2023algorithmic"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Compliance Washing</strong> Akin to ethics washing practices <d-cite key="bietti2020ethics"></d-cite>, AI developers can satisfy regulatory requirements by disclosing something—even if that ``something” is incomplete, selectively positive, or methodologically weak <d-cite key="koshiyama2024towards"></d-cite>. Regulatory compliance becomes a box-ticking exercise, undermining the goals of safety, accountability, and public trust <d-cite key="veale2021demystifying"></d-cite>.</p> <p>These crises highlight that the problem is not only how models are evaluated, but how those evaluations are reported. In the next section, we examine limitations of current standardization efforts and introduce EvalCards as a practical solution for improving evaluation reporting.</p> <h2 id="problems-with-existing-standards">Problems with Existing Standards</h2> <p><strong>Lack of evaluation focus</strong> Existing documentation frameworks rarely place evaluation at the center. Model Cards, DataSheets, and FactSheets typically treat evaluation results as only one component among many. BenchmarkCards <d-cite key="sokol2024benchmarkcards"></d-cite> focuses on information specific to a single benchmark only, with no reference to models. For large language models, however, evaluation is the primary means by which users, researchers, and regulators can understand capabilities and limitations.</p> <p><strong>High effort for developers</strong> Most of the proposed documents, like Model Cards <d-cite key="mitchell2019model"></d-cite>, are lengthy and time-consuming to produce since they require additional analysis like listing out all possible use-cases and users, detailed demographic factor evaluation, intersectional quantitative analyses, etc. This can be especially problematic when many models are being released at a rapid pace. Dedicating extra time to such detailed analysis may not be possible.</p> <p><strong>Limited accessibility for non-experts</strong> For decision-makers, policymakers, and many end-users, these documents are often too technical or jargon-heavy to offer real clarity <d-cite key="mcgregor2025err, crisan2022interactive"></d-cite>. For example, OpenAI’s system cards, like the <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/">GPT-4o card</a>, offer in-depth safety and governance information but are often very lengthy and complex. As a result, even when provided, they are underutilized by key stakeholders <d-cite key="blodgett-etal-2024-human"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Lack of visibility</strong> While earlier works have talked about model documentation, not many have emphasized the need for visibility. Today, information about models is frequently buried in supplemental materials, obscure repositories, or separate websites—making it difficult to access and easy to overlook <d-cite key="mcgregor2025err"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="evalcards">EvalCards</h2> <p>To address the challenges outlined in previous sections, we propose Evaluation Disclosure Cards (EvalCards), a short-form standardized reporting format for model evaluations. In this section, we discuss the design principles of an EvalCard, what it should contain, when it should be created, and where it should be available.</p> <h3 id="design-principles-of-evalcards">Design Principles of EvalCards</h3> <p>Any reporting format must go beyond existing documentation efforts by tackling the practical barriers identified above: focusing on evaluation, reducing the burden on developers, making results clear to a wide range of users, and ensuring that evaluation information is consistently visible wherever models are accessed. We summarize the design principles here:</p> <p><strong>Evaluation Focus</strong> Unlike broader documentation frameworks such as Model Cards or DataSheets, which include information about training data, intended use cases, and ethical considerations, EvalCards place evaluation at the center. The goal is not to capture every possible aspect of model development, but to provide clear and standardized details about what was evaluated, how it was evaluated, and under what conditions.</p> <p><strong>Easy to Write</strong> For transparency to become standard practice, evaluation reporting must be easy to implement. EvalCards are designed to capture only the essential details of model evaluation, making them quick to produce and maintain. This is especially important for smaller organizations and open-source model developers that lack the resources to run large test suites.</p> <p><strong>Easy to Understand</strong> Transparency is meaningless if only a handful of experts can interpret it. Evaluation reports must be designed for broad accessibility, enabling not just researchers but also all those without domain expertise to grasp a model’s capabilities and risks quickly.</p> <p><strong>Hard to Miss</strong> As discussed, evaluation details are buried in academic papers, supplementary materials, or hidden deep within repositories. Standardized evaluation reports should be integrated directly into any landing pages where models can be accessed, whether that is on HuggingFace Hub, API dashboards, or third-party model provider repositories. By ensuring that evaluation disclosures are always visible and linked to the model itself, we would create a culture where understanding a model’s capabilities and risks becomes a default part of using models, not an optional deep dive.</p> <h3 id="what-should-an-evalcard-contain">What should an EvalCard contain?</h3> <p><strong>Modalities Evaluated</strong> EvalCards specify which input and output modalities—such as text, image, or audio—the model has been evaluated on.</p> <p><strong>Languages Evaluated</strong> As with modalities, clearly stating which languages a model has evaluated on helps define the scope of its real-world applicability. Many models advertise multilingual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">training'' or</code>support’’, but such claims do not indicate whether those languages have been explicitly tested in any systematic way. Without evaluation, such claims can be misleading <d-cite key="joshi-etal-2020-state, blasi-etal-2022-systematic,talat-etal-2022-reap"></d-cite></p> <p><strong>Capability Evaluation</strong> EvalCards do not prescribe specific benchmarks, but we require developers to explicitly state which core abilities (e.g., summarization, reasoning, factual recall, mathematical problem solving) were evaluated, and to indicate the benchmark chosen for each. Additionally, all reported results should be accompanied by the metric used (e.g., exact match, accuracy, precision@1), zero-shot prompting strategy (to enable better baseline comparison across models), and any alternative prompting strategies tested (e.g., few-shot, chain-of-thought).</p> <p><strong>Safety Evaluation</strong> AI models pose well-documented risks, such as bias <d-cite key="dai2024bias"></d-cite>, toxicity <d-cite key="luong-etal-2024-realistic"></d-cite>, and misinformation generation <d-cite key="zhang2024toward, chen2024combating"></d-cite>. These issues are often under-reported or selectively presented in current evaluation practices <d-cite key="burnell2023rethink, mcgregor2025err"></d-cite>. EvalCards should include a dedicated section for such safety risks. As with capability evaluations, developers should specify the safety feature evaluated, the benchmarks used, the metrics applied, and both the zero-shot and any alternative prompting scores.</p> <p><strong>Developer Footnotes</strong> In this free-text section of the EvalCard, model developers can choose to have relevant footnotes or include any information they think is relevant for users.</p> <h3 id="when-should-evalcards-be-created">When should EvalCards be created?</h3> <p>EvalCards should be generated as part of the initial model release workflow, whether for open-source models or commercial APIs. <em>First,</em> model developers are the ones who trained the model, chose the data, designed the architecture, and tuned the objectives. Standardized evaluation reporting works best when it is done by the people who know the model inside out and at the point of release. Also, most of these evaluations align with internal testing already conducted by developers during model validation phases, and direct reporting can prevent multiple runs of the model on the same tests, leading to reduced climate impact. <em>Second,</em> most models that require evaluation today—especially large foundation models with hundreds of billions of parameters—are built by organizations with substantial compute resources. If a team can train a model with billions of parameters, it is likely to have enough compute to run a standard suite of evaluations.</p> <p>By embedding EvalCard creation into the release pipeline, developers ensure that transparency is delivered upfront, not left to third-party auditors. Furthermore, EvalCards should be updated with each major version change or significant fine-tuning event, reflecting how model behavior may evolve. This keeps users informed of both improvements and potential regressions across the capability and safety dimensions.</p> <h3 id="where-should-evalcards-be-displayed">Where should EvalCards be displayed?</h3> <p>Visibility is a core principle of EvalCards: Evaluation summaries should appear where the model appears. This includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Model Repositories</strong>: EvalCards should be a standard, prominently linked file in Huggingface Hub or Github—similar to a README or license—ensuring that anyone downloading or browsing the model can immediately access it.</li> <li><strong>Commercial Platforms</strong>: For closed-source or hosted models accessed through APIs or user interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini), EvalCards should be integrated into developer dashboards, product documentation, or user-facing pages. This allows users to review evaluation and safety information before deployment or interaction, supporting informed use and regulatory compliance.</li> <li><strong>Research Publications</strong>: For both open and closed-source models, EvalCards should be present as a section in the main text or appendix of academic papers and any technical blogs as a concise summary of evaluation results—providing a clear alternative to selective performance highlights.</li> </ul> <h3 id="model-card-vs-evalcard">Model Card vs EvalCard</h3> <p>Model Cards <d-cite key="mitchell2019model"></d-cite> are an early effort at increasing transparency. However, EvalCards are not designed to serve the same purpose and are complementary to Model Cards. Below, we highlight how EvalCards differ from Model Cards and why they are essential in the current landscape:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Evaluation Focus:</strong> Model Cards were developed at a time when most models were custom-built, and detailed information about training, design motivations, and use cases was essential. EvalCards elevate evaluation to the primary focus and provides a decision-time snapshot to help users and regulators quickly evaluate if a model is appropriate for their needs.</li> <li><strong>Ease of Adoption:</strong> Model Cards focus on open-ended description of model information, including detailed analysis of ethnographic and ethical considerations. However, it can serve as a barrier to adoption by overwhelming end-users with less technical expertise. EvalCards are designed to be lightweight and easy to adopt, with structured fields that capture high-signal evaluation details with minimal overhead.</li> <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Model Cards do not specify where or how they should be displayed, and the information is often buried across multiple sources. EvalCards are displayed where the model is accessed—on model hubs, APIs, or UIs.</li> </ul> <p>As the norm shifts towards the use of off-the-shelf generative AI models, evaluation becomes the key requirement for responsible model deployment.</p> <h2 id="evalcards-case-studies">EvalCards Case Studies</h2> <p>To implement our idea, we started with case studies of three popular LLMs. We document the issues we found for collecting details for each model’s evaluation followed by the creation of an EvalCard for each model. In Fig 1, we create an EvalCard for the model <em>OLMO-2-1124-7B-Instruct</em>, from the OLMo project on transparency and open research from the Allen Institute for AI <d-cite key="olmo20252olmo2furious"></d-cite>- which despite being one of the most open models. Metrics and prompting details were dispersed across sources and inconsistent across benchmarks. Accessibility was limited by scattered results throughout the paper, hindering quick assessment. Safety reporting was aggregated into a single score, offering no dataset-level transparency and preventing meaningful analysis of specific risks.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_olmo-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_olmo-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_olmo-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_olmo.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>In Fig 2, we have an EvalCard for Qwen3-4B-Base, released on the 29th of April 2025. The model’s release lacked timely and transparent evaluation details: key results were delayed, language coverage and capability claims were ambiguous, and many benchmarks lacked metrics or prompting information. Safety evaluations were entirely absent, making it difficult for users to reliably assess the model’s performance or risks.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_qwen-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_qwen-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_qwen-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_qwen.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>In Fig 3, we create an EvalCard for Gemini Flash 2.0 which lacks clear, comprehensive documentation: multilingual support is vaguely described without evidence of evaluated performance, benchmark scores omit metrics and prompting details, and no concrete safety evaluations or red-teaming results are disclosed. As a result, users must rely on incomplete information when assessing the model’s actual capabilities and risks.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_gemini-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_gemini-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_gemini-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-evalcards/evalcard_gemini.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>These case studies reveal a common thread: while open-source models like OLMo 2 generally provide more information than their closed counterparts, the process of compiling that information remains time-consuming and often incomplete. EvalCards offer a structured way to consolidate key details in one place, reducing the need to spend hours navigating scattered documentation and supplementary sources. More importantly, EvalCards make it immediately visible what’s missing—turning the absence of evaluation details from something easy to hide into something impossible to ignore. For model providers, EvalCards serve as both a checklist and a commitment: a clear reminder of what transparency actually requires and a visible demonstration of their willingness to provide it.</p> <h2 id="alternative-views">Alternative Views</h2> <p>While we advocate for the adoption of EvalCards, it is important to acknowledge reasonable concerns from different stakeholders. Here, we outline two commonly raised perspectives and address them.</p> <p><strong>A Developer’s View</strong> Developers may argue that evaluation is already done internally, and publishing it publicly increases workload or reputational risk, especially when performance is uneven. However, as regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act and US or UK guidelines begin to demand transparency in model capabilities and risks <d-cite key="act2024eu"></d-cite>, structured evaluation disclosures might become a requirement, not a preference. EvalCards offer a proactive way to meet these expectations. Even seeing what has not been evaluated is useful to avoid misinterpretations and build credibility ahead of external audits or compliance checks <d-cite key="raji2020closing, koshiyama2024towards"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>A Researcher’s View</strong> Researchers may note that evaluation is context-sensitive, where evaluations vary by tasks <d-cite key="chang2024survey"></d-cite> or user groups <d-cite key="hershcovich-etal-2022-challenges"></d-cite> and that standards for ``good’’ benchmarks are still evolving <d-cite key="reuel2024betterbench,liu-etal-2024-ecbd, blodgett-etal-2024-human"></d-cite>. Introducing a fixed reporting format might seem premature. But EvalCards are not rigid templates. They do not enforce benchmark choices but merely require clarity about what was tested and how. This transparency helps everyone interpret results accurately, compare across models, and build on prior evaluations rather than duplicating or misapplying them.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Evaluation reporting is a critical but under-prioritized part of responsible NLP and AI. Non-standardized practices create hurdles for researchers, users, and regulators, fueling reproducibility, accessibility, and governance crises. Existing documentation efforts like Model Cards <d-cite key="mitchell2019model"></d-cite> or BenchmarkCards <d-cite key="sokol2024benchmarkcards"></d-cite> have aimed to improved transparency, but they do not put evaluation at the center. EvalCards aim to close this gap with a format that is easy to write, easy to understand, and hard to miss. By making evaluation details visible and consistent, they turn scattered disclosures into a foundation for cumulative research, informed adoption, and accountability. Looking ahead, we highlight three directions to strengthen and extend the EvalCard framework.</p> <p><strong>Increased Transparency</strong> EvalCards can help establish a unified pipeline that links evaluation and reporting into a single transparent process by reducing ambiguity across sources <d-cite key="biderman2024lessons"></d-cite>. In the longer term, EvalCards could link to Benchmark Cards <d-cite key="sokol2024benchmarkcards"></d-cite> for each mentioned benchmark, creating a connected reporting ecosystem where model, benchmark, and evaluation details are transparently linked to ensure that both the tests and the results behind model claims are easy to trace and verify.</p> <p><strong>Increased Adoption</strong> Widespread adoption will require making EvalCards easy to produce and use. Methods like automated extraction from technical reports <d-cite key="liu-etal-2024-automatic"></d-cite> or community contribution to scores <d-cite key="10855627"></d-cite> can help ease the burden on model developers, while usability testing can help refine design and language for diverse stakeholders <d-cite key="crisan2022interactive"></d-cite>. This will help ensure that EvalCards are not only technically sound but also popular.</p> <p><strong>Regulatory Integration</strong> EvalCards can play a key role in bridging technical evaluation and regulatory transparency. They can serve as a standardized reporting format for models within compliance processes, such as regulatory sandboxes under the EU AI Act <d-cite key="lanamaki2025expect"></d-cite> or US AI Risk Management Framework <d-cite key="ai2023artificial"></d-cite>, by offering a consistent way to report model performance and limitations. Partnerships with platforms like HuggingFace or emerging standards bodies could help maintain vetted benchmark sets that align with evolving priorities. Future work in technical governance <d-cite key="reuel2024open, reuel2024position"></d-cite> can explore how EvalCards can be incorporated into regulatory compliance workflows, e.g., by establishing minimum mandatory fields tied to emerging AI regulations.</p> <p>As model development accelerates, reporting practices must evolve with equal urgency. Evaluation should drive progress, not confusion—but that is only possible when what models can and cannot do is made clear. EvalCards take a small but concrete step toward that goal, embedding transparency into the model release process itself. We hope this work sparks deeper reflection and concrete action toward standardizing how we evaluate and report on models.</p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the age of rapidly released LLMs, evaluation reporting is fragmented, inconsistent, and often misleading.
